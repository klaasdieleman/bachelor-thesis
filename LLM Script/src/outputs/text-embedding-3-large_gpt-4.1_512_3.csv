63,0,"Is the metric or unit of time used in the statistical model reported? (i.e., wave, hours, days, weeks, months, years, etc.)","To answer this question, I must identify if the context specifies the time metric or unit (e.g., wave, years, months) used in the statistical models. The context mentions assessment waves in the measurement invariance analysis, such as, ""the unidimensional anger construct being fit at each assessment wave,"" and, ""item loadings and thresholds allowed to vary across time."" Further, the context refers to ages (e.g., age -16, age -28), and years (e.g., ""participants were an average of 31 years old,"" ""after age 18""). However, specifically in the statistical modeling sections, the models are described in terms of ""assessment waves"" and ages, indicating that data points were collected at discrete assessment periods, each corresponding to a specific wave or age. This makes it clear that the unit of time used in the models is ""wave"" (assessment wave) and/or ""years"" (specific ages)."," - ""the unidimensional anger construct being fit at each assessment wave"" - ""item loadings and thresholds allowed to vary across time"" - ""the factor structure of the anger measure separately at each measurement period"" - ""330 were included in the cognitive control follow-up study (at age -16)."" - ""289 had adulthood outcome data available (at age -28).""",YES

This typically refers to a description of how much time has passed or the spread of timing for data collection at a specific wave in a longitudinal study. The context gives detailed information about the sample size, missing data, group comparisons, measurement models, longitudinal invariance, and the latent class growth analysis.

The context mentions missing data, providing information about the composition of the analyzed samples and stating that only participants with complete data were included in certain analyses. Additionally, it is stated that ""maximum likelihood estimation"" was used in LCGA models with a robustness to missing data under the missing at random assumption. However, there is no explicit statement of a general missing data handling strategy for all analyses; for main outcome analyses, it states only that ""only the 289 substudy participants with complete data were included,"" implying listwise deletion, but this is not directly labeled as such. No imputation or FIML is mentioned."," - ""Models were specified using maximum likelihood estimation with standard errors and a chi-square statistic that is robust to nonnormality, which allows for missing data under the assumption it is missing at random."" - ""When predicting adulthood outcomes, only the 289 substudy participants with complete data were included.""",NO

While several analytic methods are described (e.g., latent class growth analysis, measurement invariance testing), there is no mention of conducting or reporting tests of normality.

The context describes that three classes were selected using statistical tests and provides some numeric model fit indices (AIC, BIC, etc.), but it does not present the expected characteristics of each latent class (e.g., class sizes, group means, SE) in tabular or textual form. The presented regression tables mostly aggregate across models or address covariate effects without explicit subclass breakdowns, and there is no direct statement of means, sample sizes, or SEs for each class."," - ""The right panes describe the average growth for the unobserved threeclass subgroups of bullying growth trajectories."" - ""After identifying a finite number of unobserved subgroups in bullying growth trajectories, the primary analysis was conducted to examine impacts of covariates (low self-control and opportunity factors) on latent class membership, controlling for adolescent sex and school location."" - []",NO
2,18,"Are the syntax files available (either in the appendix, supplementary materials, or from the authors)?","To determine if the syntax files are available, I need to look for explicit statements in the context indicating their availability in the appendix, supplementary materials, or through request from the authors. The context contains extensive statistical information, model details, and notes, but there is no mention of syntax file availability, sharing statements, or any appendix/supplementary materials referencing syntax. Therefore, the answer is NO.", - [],NO
