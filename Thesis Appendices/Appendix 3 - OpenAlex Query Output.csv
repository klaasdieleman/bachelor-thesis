Trajectories of male sexual aggression from adolescence through college: A latent class growth analysis,"Approximately 25% of male college students report engaging in some form of sexual coercion by the end of their fourth year of college. White and Smith (2004) found that negative childhood experiences-childhood sexual abuse, childhood physical abuse, and witnessing domestic violence-predicted sexual aggression perpetrated before college, but not during the subsequent college years, a puzzling finding in view of the reasonably consistent rates of sexual aggression from adolescence to the first 2 years of college. The current study takes a person-centered approach to sexual aggression in an attempt to resolve this discrepancy. We examined the possibility of cohesive subgroups of men in terms of their frequency of sexual aggression across the pre-college and college years. A series of latent class growth models were fit to an existing longitudinal dataset of sexual experiences collected across four time points-pre-college through year 3 of college. A four-trajectory model fit the data well, exhibiting significantly better fit than a three-trajectory model. The four trajectories are interpreted as men who perpetrate sexual aggression at (1) low (71.5% of the sample), (2) moderate (21.2%), (3) decreasing (4.2%), and (4) increasing (3.1%) frequencies across time. Negative childhood experiences predicted membership of the decreasing trajectory, relative to the low trajectory, but did not predict membership of the increasing trajectory, explaining the discrepancy uncovered by White and Smith. Implications for primary prevention of sexual aggression are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ab.21584,
The prevalence rate of sexual violence worldwide: a trend analysis,"Abstract Background The purpose of the present study is to showcase the image of Sexual Violence (SV) temporal trends through exploring differences in its prevalence rates during 1990–2017 across 195 countries and territories. Methods The SV prevalence rates were derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database during 1990–2017, worldwide. First, the Latent Growth Model (LGM) was employed for assessing the change in SV prevalence rate over time in Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, Australia &amp; Oceania, for men and women separately. Then, the change in SV prevalence rate over time was determined within countries with high and low Human Development Index (HDI). Finally, the Latent Growth Mixture Models (LGMM) were applied for identifying classes where countries within each class have similar trend of SV prevalence rate over time. Results The SV prevalence was higher among women than men and decreased in both genders over time across the world. The declining trend in SV prevalence against men is visible in both countries with high and low HDI, but SV prevalence against women in countries with low HDI shows an increase. The findings of LGMM identified six classes of SV prevalence trajectories. LGMM allocated Bermuda into the class with the highest decrease in SV prevalence against men, and Equatorial Guinea and Luxembourg into the class with the highest increase. Other countries had very slow declining trends. In terms of SV prevalence against women, LGMM allocated China, North Korea, and Taiwan into the class with the most increase among the countries in the world. Bermuda, Guyana, Mexico, Nigeria, and Saint Lucia were placed into the class which witnessed the largest decline and Angola, Congo, and Equatorial Guinea were ranked next. The trend in other countries was mostly decreasing. Conclusion Given the high economic and social burden that SV has on victims and societies, the rate of SV in most countries does not seem to have dropped remarkably and requires special attention by relevant policymakers. The SV prevalence rate is highly heterogeneous among world countries which may be due to the definitions and tools used, and more importantly, the culture norms.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09926-5,
Impacts of Low Self-Control and Delinquent Peer Associations on Bullying Growth Trajectories Among Korean Youth: A Latent Growth Mixture Modeling Approach,"The emergence of studies applying Gottfredson and Hirschi’s (1990) self-control theory to offending behaviors has produced empirical support confirming the position that individuals with low self-control are more likely to engage in deviant behaviors. However, few have examined its effects with opportunity factors. The present study examines the time-invariant effect of low self-control, as well as the time-concurrent and lagged effects of opportunity factors (parental attachment and delinquent peer associations), on bullying growth trajectories. The findings in the latent growth curve analysis demonstrate that low self-control is significantly related to both the initial levels and change in bullying over time, even after controlling for delinquent peer associations in homogeneous populations. The new approach described within the latent class growth modeling framework (i.e., growth mixture) incorporates a categorical latent trajectory variable representing latent classes (i.e., distinct subgroups), having similar patterns of bullying growth trajectories. Three groups of students emerged from the student-reported data at five time points from ages 11 to 15, decreasers (90%), moderate late peakers (7%), and high late peakers(3%), defined by different predictors and sequelae. Low self-control was rendered insignificant for both moderate late peakers and high late peakers relative to decreasers; delinquent peer associations had a time-concurrent effect for moderate late peakers than decreasers; and high late peakers had a time-lagged effect relative to moderate late peakers.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260518786495,
The Development of Deviant and Delinquent Behavior of Adolescents: Applications of Latent Class Growth Curves and Growth Mixture Models,"This chapter discusses the systematic comparison of the latent class growth model and the more general growth mixture model within the framework of Mplus. A representative panel study of adolescents' deviant and delinquent behavior served as database for the systematic study of growth mixtures. The chapter introduces design of the study, variables, and descriptive statistics. It addresses the question of how many distinctive groups exists in the data under the assumption of the latent class growth model. Based on the results, studies various growth mixture models allowing random intercepts and slopes. The chapter summarizes the results and discusses suggestions for further research with growth mixture models. Longitudinal research studies with repeated measurements are quite often used to examine processes of stability and change in individuals or groups. With panel data it is possible to investigate intraindividual development of substantive variables across time as well as interindividual differences and similarities in change patterns.",https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315091655-10,
Delinquency in Emerging Adulthood: Insights into Trajectories of Young Adults in a German Sample and Implications for Measuring Continuity of Offending,"Abstract The majority of studies within the framework of Developmental and Life-Course Criminology focus on adolescence. There are even fewer studies that deal with heterotypic measures of delinquency. This study fills a gap in the literature by targeting exclusively the period of emerging adulthood (ages 18 to 28) and scrutinizing different trajectories and patterns of offending (offending portfolios) thereof. We discuss the topic of continuity of offending with changing opportunity structures for an adult population via contrast of one set of delinquent behaviors reflecting opportunity structures in adolescence (youth set) and one where adult-appropriate criminal activities were added (total set). We applied latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to both sets in a sample of 1810 German men and women aged 18 to 28 years. During emerging adulthood, average crime versatility and incidences increase slightly with items of the total set, while it decreases with only the youth set. LCGA on the total set reveals five meaningful trajectories with declining but also increasing slopes. Among these is one trajectory of innocuous adolescents, who start an offending career with mainly adult crimes during emerging adulthood. Of the sample, 45.25% reported at least one offense during that period. Traffic offenses and fraud are the most prevalent types of offending. While the sample’s majority is considered non-offenders, emerging adults do not entirely cease to commit offenses. Instead, they shift their preference towards age-appropriate and covert ways to act anti-socially. Trajectory groups reflect proclivities towards either youth, adult, or a mix of both types of crime.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s40865-020-00157-1,
Exploration and explanation of adolescent self-reported delinquency trajectories in the Crimoc study,"This chapter provides an overview of the key findings on the exploration and explanation of self-reported delinquency trajectories in the German prospective panel study Crime in the modern city (Crimoc). It outlines the study with regard to design, theoretical framework and assumptions regarding the explanation and courses of delinquent behaviour during adolescence. The chapter considers the study's socio-demographic and penal circumstances. It explains basic information and descriptive statistics for the panel data and measures used in the current analysis. The chapter discusses the statistical methods to explore and explain distinct trajectories of self-reported delinquency. Finally, the presentation of the results of the statistical analysis is divided in two parts: First, the basic pattern of delinquent trajectories during adolescence and young adulthood is described on the basis of a latent class growth analysis (LCGA). Second, patterns of theoretically relevant variables representing social values, social bonds and attitudes towards delinquency are used to explain membership in a particular class of offenders.",https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315747996-10,
Maltreatment in childhood and intimate partner violence: A latent class growth analysis in a South African pregnancy cohort,"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a significant global problem, prevalent in low and middle-income countries (LMICs). IPV is particularly problematic during the perinatal and early postnatal period, where it is linked with negative maternal and child health outcomes. There has been little examination of profiles of IPV and early life adversity in LMIC contexts. We aimed to characterize longitudinal IPV and to investigate maternal maltreatment in childhood as a predictor of IPV exposure during pregnancy and postnatally in a low resource setting. This study was nested in the Drakenstein Child Health Study, a longitudinal birth cohort. Maternal IPV (emotional, physical and sexual) was measured at six timepoints from pregnancy to two years postpartum (n = 832); sociodemographic variables and maternal maltreatment in childhood were measured antenatally at 28–32 weeks' gestation. Associations between maternal maltreatment in childhood and IPV latent class membership (to identify patterns of maternal IPV exposure) were estimated using multinomial and logistic regression. We observed high levels of maternal maltreatment during childhood (34%) and IPV during pregnancy (33%). In latent class analysis separating by IPV sub-type, two latent classes of no/low and moderate sexual IPV and three classes of low, moderate, and high emotional and physical IPV (separately) were detected. In combined latent class analysis, including all IPV sub-types together, a low, moderate and high exposure class emerged as well as a high antenatal/decreasing postnatal class. Moderate and high classes for all IPV sub-types and combined analysis showed stable intensity profiles. Maternal childhood sexual abuse, physical abuse and neglect, and emotional abuse predicted membership in high IPV classes, across all domains of IPV (aORs between 1.99 and 5.86). Maternal maltreatment in childhood was associated with increased probability of experiencing high or moderate intensity IPV during and around pregnancy; emotional neglect was associated with decreasing IPV class for combined model. Intervening early to disrupt this cycle of abuse is critical to two generations.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2018.08.020,
Developmental Trajectories of Delinquent Peer Association Among Korean Adolescents: A Latent Class Growth Analysis Approach to Assessing Peer Selection and Socialization Effects on Online and Offline Crimes,"The relationship between peers and delinquency has been taken as evidence for selection and socialization effects in the etiology of adolescents. Accumulating evidence suggests that both effects are involved. This study examines whether adolescents’ aggressive propensities and behaviors predict their peers (selection) and whether peers’ propensities and behaviors predict adolescents’ behaviors (socialization). The latent class growth analysis approach revealed three distinct subgroups: an early-onset group (0.9%); a late-peak group (3.37%); and a normative group (95.73%). Both selection and socialization effects were supported using a longitudinal Korean adolescent self-report. The results showed that adolescents with less self-control who are online more frequently and exhibit higher levels of traditional bullying and delinquency were more likely to be members of both the early-onset and late-peak groups compared with the normative group. Also, the aggressive behaviors fully mediated the link between aggressive propensities and delinquent peer associations. Furthermore, adolescents in the late-peak group (but not those in the early-onset group) were associated with a greater likelihood of online and offline delinquency, but cyberbullying and traditional bullying in late adolescence levels were high in both groups’ members.",https://doi.org/10.1177/10439862211001617,
The quest for identity in adolescence: Heterogeneity in daily identity formation and psychosocial adjustment across 5 years.,"Identity formation is one of the key developmental tasks in adolescence.According to Erikson (1968) experiencing identity uncertainty is normative in adolescence.However, empirical studies investigating identity uncertainty on a daily basis are lacking.Hence, studying individual differences in daily certainty (i.e., identity commitment levels) and uncertainty (i.e., identity commitment fluctuations and identity reconsideration) in the identity formation process may advance our knowledge about the extent to which adolescents' identity uncertainty is part of normative identity development.Therefore, this longitudinal study examined heterogeneity in certainty and uncertainty dynamics of adolescents' daily identity formation using a longitudinal microlevel approach.Dutch adolescents (N ϭ 494; M age ϭ 13.03 years at T1; 56.7% boys) reported on 2 key dimensions of identity formation (i.e., commitment and reconsideration) in both the educational and interpersonal domain on a daily basis for 3 weeks within 1 year, across 5 successive years.Multivariate latent class growth analyses suggested both in the educational and interpersonal identity domain a class of adolescents displaying a ""crisis-like"" identity formation process, and an ""identity synthesis"" class.Classes revealed differential development of (global and school) anxiety, aggression, and best friend support.Taken together, the present study confirmed Erikson's notion that experiencing daily identity uncertainty is common during adolescence.However, a substantial amount of adolescents also showed a process toward identity maturation already during adolescence.",https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0000245,
"Violent offending among juveniles: A 7-year longitudinal study of recidivism, desistance, and associations with mental health.","Serious and violent offending among juveniles is a consistent concern of researchers, practitioners, and policymakers, yet the development of violent offending remains poorly understood because of limited availability of relevant data, small sample sizes, and shortage of longitudinal data sets. This study analyzed developmental patterns of violent offending over 7 years in the complete population of court-referred youth in Connecticut between 2006 and 2012 (N = 58,678; mean age at first offense = 14.7 years). This unique dataset provided several key findings: First, results from a latent class growth analysis showed that violent crimes peaked at age 14-15, with high-rate adolescent offenders (3.7% of the sample) accounting for 31.9% of all violent offenses. Further, 74.2% of this group desisted from violent crimes in adulthood. Higher levels of self-reported anger/irritability slightly increased the odds of violent recidivism (odds ratio, OR = 1.09), where higher levels of depression/anxiety depressed the odds (OR = 0.89). The overrepresentation of males, non-Hispanic Black, and Hispanic youth among high-rate adolescence offenders were traceable through adolescence but not beyond the age of 18. Together, these finding may help to inform new delinquency interventions that target the needs of this proportionally small group of violent adolescent offenders accounting for a large amount of violent crimes.

Developmental Trajectories of Chinese Adolescents’ Relational Aggression: Associations With Changes in Social‐Psychological Adjustment,"This study investigated the development of relational aggression (RA) in a sample of Chinese youth ( N = 2,274, 52% boys) from fourth ( M age = 10.27 years) to ninth grade. Using latent class growth analysis, four trajectories were identified for both peer‐ and teacher‐rated RA: a no aggression trajectory, a low‐increasing trajectory, a moderate‐decreasing trajectory, and a chronically high trajectory. Chronically high RA showed a chronicity effect on adolescent peer acceptance, rejection, and rule‐breaking behaviors. Adolescents showed worse adjustment as RA increased, but they did not necessarily evidence significant improvement in adjustment even if their RA decreased. Findings reveal the maladaptive nature of RA and highlight the importance of considering cultural context in understanding RA.",https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13090,
From prison to the streets: Can importation work in reverse?,"The purpose of this study was to determine whether prison misconduct is capable of predicting rearrest and whether criminal thinking plays a role in this relationship. Two hypotheses, a variable-centered hypothesis and a person-centered hypothesis, were tested in a group of 951 male federal inmates, with results showing that at the variable level, prison misconduct predicted arrests for more serious crimes (person offenses) but not for less serious crimes (nonperson offenses). In an effort to examine the prison misconduct-community recidivism relationship at the person level, latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was performed on offending indicators across 3 nonoverlapping time periods: before prison (prior convictions), in prison (annual rate of incident reports), and after prison (total subsequent arrests). The LCGA results revealed a large decelerating pattern and 3 smaller accelerating patterns. Criminal thinking successfully distinguished between the 2 patterns after controlling for age and criminal history. The present findings suggest that prison can have a deterrent effect (decelerating pattern) or a criminogenic effect (accelerating patterns) after a person's release from prison and that criminal thinking may put one at risk for entry into the accelerating pattern.

An Evaluation of Dual Systems Theories of Adolescent Delinquency in a Normative Longitudinal Cohort Study of Youth,"Abstract Dual systems theories of adolescent risk-taking propose that the socioemotional and self-regulation systems develop at different rates, resulting in a peak in sensation-seeking in adolescence at a time when self-regulation abilities are not yet fully mature. This “developmental imbalance” between bottom-up drives for reward and top-down control is proposed to create a period of vulnerability for high-risk behaviors such as delinquency, substance use, unprotected sex, and reckless driving. In this study, data from the Swiss longitudinal normative z-proso study ( n = 1522, n = 784 male; aged 11, 13, 15, 17, and 20) were used to test whether the presence of a developmental imbalance between sensation-seeking and self-regulation is associated with trajectories of engagement in delinquency across early adolescence to adulthood. Using a latent class growth analysis of sensation-seeking, self-regulation, and delinquency, it was found that a model with 3 classes was optimal in the whole sample and male sub-sample, including one class characterized by a developmental imbalance and corresponding adolescent peak in delinquency. In females, there was no evidence for a class that could be described according to the trajectories hypothesized in dual systems theory. This study’s results support the claim that a developmental imbalance may drive an adolescent increase in delinquency. However, this applies only to a small subgroup of individuals, particularly males.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-021-01433-z,
Developmental Trajectories of Marijuana Use among Men,"Objectives: Examine whether young men who chronically use marijuana are at risk for engaging in drug-related and non-drug-related criminal offending and exhibiting psychopathic personality features in their mid-30s. Methods: Patterns of marijuana use were delineated in a sample of predominately Black and White young men from adolescence to the mid-20s using latent class growth curve analysis. Self-report and official records of criminal offending and psychopathic personality features were assessed in the mid-30s. Analyses controlled for multiple factors indicative of a preexisting antisocial lifestyle and co-occurring use of other substances and tested for moderation by race. Results: Four latent marijuana trajectory groups were identified: chronic high, adolescence-limited, late increasing, and low/nonusers. Relative to low/nonusers, chronic high and late increasing marijuana users exhibited more adult psychopathic features and were more likely to engage in drug-related offending during their mid-30s. Adolescence-limited users were similar to low/nonusers in terms of psychopathic features but were more likely to be arrested for drug-related crimes. No trajectory group differences were found for violence or theft, and the group differences were not moderated by race. Conclusions: Young men who engage in chronic marijuana use from adolescence into their 20s are at increased risk for exhibiting psychopathic features, dealing drugs, and enduring drug-related legal problems in their mid-30s relative to men who remain abstinent or use infrequently.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0022427815589816,
Patterns of adverse childhood experiences and depressive symptom trajectories in young adults: A longitudinal study of college students in China,"Background Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) tend to cluster together in daily life, and most studies focus on the level of depression at certain points, but the dynamic process of depression is often neglected. Thus, research is urgently needed to explore the relationship between ACEs pattern and trajectory of depressive symptom levels at multiple time points in order to provides early targeted interventions to those who are most at risk. Objective We aimed to explore patterns of ACEs, including types and timing, associated with depression trajectories in college students. Methods A school-based health survey was used to collect data as part of a longitudinal study in two medical college in Anhui province, China. Questionnaires were issued to 3,662 participants aged 17–22 and recorded details of ACEs (types and timing) and depression. Latent class analysis (LCA) was used to identify “patterns” of ACEs type and timing. Depressive symptom trajectories employed latent class growth analysis (LCGA). Multiple logistic regressions were employed to evaluate the relationships between ACEs patterns and depressive symptom trajectories. Results We identified five ACEs patterns: “High neglect/emotional abuse/community violence,” “High neglect/emotional abuse,” “High neglect/family dysfunction,” “High neglect,” “Low ACEs.” We traced three depression trajectories: “High depressive symptom” “Moderate depressive symptom,” “Low depressive symptom.” “High neglect/emotional abuse/community violence,” “High neglect/emotional abuse” and “High neglect/family dysfunction” demonstrated a high risk for “High depressive symptom” and “Moderate depressive symptom.” “High neglect” showed a high risk for “Moderate depressive symptom” but not for “High depressive symptom” ( P &amp;lt; 0.05). Conclusions The findings address the need for a comprehensive consideration of exposure to childhood adversity associated with the risk of depression in young adults through identifying more problematic ACEs patterns amongst exposed children.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.918092,
Trajectory Analysis of the Campus Serial Rapist Assumption,"<h3>Importance</h3> Rape on college campuses has been addressed recently by a presidential proclamation, federal legislation, advocacy groups, and popular media. Many initiatives assume that most college men who perpetrate rape are serial rapists. The scientific foundation for this perspective is surprisingly limited. <h3>Objective</h3> To determine whether a group of serial rapists exists by identifying cohesive groups of young men, indicated by their trajectories of rape likelihood across high school and college. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> Latent class growth analysis of the 2 largest longitudinal data sets of adolescent sexual violence on college campuses using 2 distinct groups of male college students. The first group was used for derivation modeling (n = 847; data collected from August 1990 through April 1995) and the second for validation modeling (n = 795; data collected from March 2008 through May 2011). Final data analyses were conducted from February 16, 2015, through February 20, 2015. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Rape perpetration assessed using the Sexual Experiences Survey. <h3>Results</h3> Across samples, 178 of 1642 participants (10.8%) reported having perpetrated at least 1 rape from 14 years of age through the end of college. A 3-trajectory model best fit both the derivation and validation data sets. Trajectories reflected low or time-limited (92.6% of participants), decreasing (5.3%), and increasing (2.1%) rape patterns. No consistently high trajectory was found. Most men who perpetrated a rape before college were classified in the decreasing trajectory. During college, the increasing trajectory included 14 men (15.2%) who reported having perpetrated a rape, the decreasing trajectory included 30 men (32.6%), and the low or time-limited included 48 men (52.2%). No participant in the low or time-limited trajectory reported perpetrating a rape during more than 1 period. Most men (67 [72.8%]) who committed college rape only perpetrated rape during 1 academic year. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> Although a small group of men perpetrated rape across multiple college years, they constituted a significant minority of those who committed college rape and did not compose the group at highest risk of perpetrating rape when entering college. Exclusive emphasis on serial predation to guide risk identification, judicial response, and rape-prevention programs is misguided. To deter college rape, prevention should be initiated before, and continue during, college. Child and adolescent health care professionals are well positioned to intervene during the early teenage years by informing parents about the early onset of nonconsensual sexual behavior.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2015.0707,
Trajectories of Screen Time across Adolescence and Their Associations with Adulthood Mental Health and Behavioral Outcomes,"Excessive screen time among adolescents is discussed as a significant public health concern. Identifying adolescent longitudinal patterns of time spent on regularly-used media screens and understanding their young adulthood mental health and behavioral issue correlates may help inform strategies for improving these outcomes. This study aimed to characterize joint developmental patterns of time spent on videogames, surfing/chatting the Internet, and TV/DVDs during adolescence (at ages 11, 13, 15, 17) and their associations with mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, suicidal ideation, and self-injury) and behavioral issues (i.e., substance use, delinquency, aggression) in early adulthood (at age 20). A parallel-process latent class growth analysis was used to model data from a diverse community-ascertained sample of youth in Zurich, Switzerland (n = 1521; 51.7% males). Results suggested that a five-class model best fitted the data: (1) low-screen use, 37.6%; (2) increasing chatting/surfing, 24.0%; (3) moderate-screen use, 18.6%; (4) early-adolescence screen use, 9.9%; and (5) increasing videogame and chatting/surfing, 9.9%. After adjusting for baseline levels of outcomes (primarily at age 11), the trajectory groups differed in their associations with adulthood outcomes of mental health and behavioral problems, indicating the importance of problematic screen usage patterns in predicting these outcomes. Future research to test the directionality of these associations will be important. These findings suggest which patterns of screen use may be a marker for later mental health and behavioral issues in different domains.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-023-01782-x,
"Moving into an urban drug scene among people who use drugs in Vancouver, Canada: Latent class growth analysis","Background Urban drug scenes are characterized by high prevalence of illicit drug dealing and use, violence and poverty, much of which is driven by the criminalization of people who use illicit drugs (PWUD) and the associated stigma. Despite significant public health needs, little is understood about patterns of moving into urban drug scenes among PWUD. Therefore, we sought to identify trajectories of residential mobility (hereafter 'mobility') among PWUD into the Downtown Eastside (DTES), an urban neighbourhood with an open drug scene in Vancouver, Canada, as well as characterize distinct trajectory groups among PWUD. Methods Data were derived from three prospective cohort studies of community-recruited PWUD in Vancouver between 2005 and 2016. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify distinct patterns of moving into the DTES among participants residing outside of DTES at baseline. Multivariable multinomial logistic regression was used to determine baseline factors associated with each trajectory group. Results In total, 906 eligible participants (30.9% females) provided 9,317 observations. The LCGA assigned four trajectories: consistently living outside of DTES (52.8%); early move into DTES (11.9%); gradual move into DTES (19.5%); and move in then out (15.8%). Younger PWUD, those of Indigenous ancestry, those who were homeless or living in a single-room occupancy hotel (SRO), and those injecting drugs daily were more likely to move in then out of DTES (all p<0.05). Living in an SRO, daily injection drug use, and recent incarceration were also positively associated with early mobility (all p<0.05). Conclusions Nearly half of the participants moved into the DTES. Younger PWUD and Indigenous peoples appeared to have particularly high mobility, as did those with markers of social-structural vulnerability and high intensity drug use. These findings indicate a need to tailor existing social and health services within the DTES and expand affordable housing options outside the DTES.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0224993,
The GRoLTS-Checklist: Guidelines for Reporting on Latent Trajectory Studies,"Estimating models within the mixture model framework, like latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) or latent class growth analysis (LCGA), involves making various decisions throughout the estimation process. This has led to a wide variety in how results of latent trajectory analysis are reported. To overcome this issue, using a 4-round Delphi study, we developed Guidelines for Reporting on Latent Trajectory Studies (GRoLTS). The purpose of GRoLTS is to present criteria that should be included when reporting the results of latent trajectory analysis across research fields. We have gone through a systematic process to identify key components that, according to a panel of experts, are necessary when reporting results for trajectory studies. We applied GRoLTS to 38 papers where LGMM or LCGA was used to study trajectories of posttraumatic stress after a traumatic event.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10705511.2016.1247646,
When Natural Disaster Follows Economic Downturn: The Incremental Impact of Multiple Stressor Events on Trajectories of Depression and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder,"Abstract Objective To determine whether there were incremental mental health impacts, specifically on depression trajectories, as a result of the 2008 economic crisis (the Great Recession) and subsequent Hurricane Sandy. Method Using latent growth mixture modeling and the ORANJ BOWL dataset, we examined prospective trajectories of depression among older adults (mean age, 60.67; SD, 6.86) who were exposed to the 2 events. We also collected community economic and criminal justice data to examine their impact upon depression trajectories. Participants (N=1172) were assessed at 3 times for affect, successful aging, and symptoms of depression. We additionally assessed posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptomology after Hurricane Sandy. Results We identified 3 prospective trajectories of depression. The majority (83.6%) had no significant change in depression from before to after these events (resilience), while 7.2% of the sample increased in depression incrementally after each event (incremental depression). A third group (9.2%) went from high to low depression symptomology following the 2 events (depressive-improving). Only those in the incremental depression group had significant PTSD symptoms following Hurricane Sandy. Conclusion We identified a small group of individuals for whom the experience of multiple stressful events had an incremental negative effect on mental health outcomes. These results highlight the importance of understanding the perseveration of depression symptomology from one event to another.

Trajectories of offending over 9 years after youths' first arrest: What predicts who desists and who continues to offend?,"Abstract Antisocial and illegal behavior generally declines as youth approach adulthood, but there is significant individual variation in the timing of the peak and decline of offending from adolescence to young adulthood. There are two primary research questions in the present study. First, are there subgroups of youth who follow similar patterns of offending over the nine years after their first arrest? Second, what baseline factors predict which youth will follow each pattern of offending? Data were drawn from the Crossroads study, which includes a sample of racially and ethnically diverse boys who were interviewed regularly for 9 years following their first arrest. Boys were between 13 and 17 years old at the start of the study and were approximately 24‐25 years old at the final interview. Trajectories were measured with youths' self‐reported offending using latent class growth analysis (LCGA). Results indicated that there were four subgroups of youth: a stable low group (55%), an escalating group (23%), a short‐term recidivist group (15%), and a persistently high group (7%). Several baseline factors distinguished the groups. In particular, the results indicated that youth who were informally processed after their first arrest were more likely to be in the low offending group than any of the other LCGA groups. Age at first arrest, peer delinquency, exposure to violence, substance use, callous‐unemotional traits, physical aggression, and perceptions of police legitimacy were also significantly related to group membership. Results suggest that certain risk factors identified after youths' first arrest may predict which youth continue to offend and which desist.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jora.12926,
Latent trajectories of adolescent antisocial behavior: Serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region (<i>5-HTTLPR</i>) genotype influences sensitivity to perceived parental support,"Although prevailing theories of antisocial behavior (ASB) emphasize distinct developmental trajectories, few studies have explored gene-environment interplay underlying membership in empirically derived trajectories. To improve knowledge about the development of overt (e.g., aggression) and covert (e.g., delinquency) ASB, we tested the association of the 44-base pair promoter polymorphism in the serotonin transporter linked polymorphic region gene (5-HTTLPR), perceived parental support (e.g., closeness and warmth), and their interaction with ASB trajectories derived using latent class growth analysis in 2,558 adolescents followed prospectively into adulthood from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health. Three distinct trajectories emerged for overt (low desisting, adolescent peak, and late onset) and covert ASB (high stable, low stable, and nonoffending). Controlling for sex, parental support inversely predicted membership in the adolescent-peak overt ASB trajectory (vs. low desisting), but was unrelated to class membership for covert ASB. Furthermore, the 5-HTTLPR genotype significantly moderated the association of parental support on overt ASB trajectory membership. It is interesting that the pattern of Gene × Environment interaction differed by trajectory class: whereas short allele carriers were more sensitive to parental support in predicting the late-onset trajectory, the long/long genotype functioned as a potential ""plasticity genotype"" for the adolescent-peak trajectory group. We discuss these preliminary findings in the context of the differential susceptibility hypothesis and discuss the need for future studies to integrate gene-environment interplay and prospective longitudinal designs.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579416000031,
Posttraumatic stress disorder symptom trajectories within the first year following emergency department admissions: pooled results from the International Consortium to predict PTSD,"Abstract Background Research exploring the longitudinal course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms has documented four modal trajectories (low, remitting, high, and delayed), with proportions varying across studies. Heterogeneity could be due to differences in trauma types and patient demographic characteristics. Methods This analysis pooled data from six longitudinal studies of adult survivors of civilian-related injuries admitted to general hospital emergency departments (EDs) in six countries (pooled N = 3083). Each study included at least three assessments of the clinician-administered PTSD scale in the first post-trauma year. Latent class growth analysis determined the proportion of participants exhibiting various PTSD symptom trajectories within and across the datasets. Multinomial logistic regression analyses examined demographic characteristics, type of event leading to the injury, and trauma history as predictors of trajectories differentiated by their initial severity and course. Results Five trajectories were found across the datasets: Low (64.5%), Remitting (16.9%), Moderate (6.7%), High (6.5%), and Delayed (5.5%). Female gender, non-white race, prior interpersonal trauma, and assaultive injuries were associated with increased risk for initial PTSD reactions. Female gender and assaultive injuries were associated with risk for membership in the Delayed ( v. Low ) trajectory, and lower education, prior interpersonal trauma, and assaultive injuries with risk for membership in the High ( v. Remitting ) trajectory. Conclusions The results suggest that over 30% of civilian-related injury survivors admitted to EDs experience moderate-to-high levels of PTSD symptoms within the first post-trauma year, with those reporting assaultive violence at increased risk of both immediate and longer-term symptoms.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291719004008,
"Trajectories of Self-control in a Forensic Psychiatric Sample: Stability and Association with Psychopathology, Criminal History, and Recidivism","The current study examined trajectories of two indicators of self-control—impulsivity and coping skills—in 317 forensic psychiatric patients, as well as associations with psychopathology, crime, and recidivism. Violent recidivism was positively associated with coping skills at admission to the clinic and with impulsivity at discharge. Only a small correlation was found between self-control and criminal history, and there was no association with psychopathology. We found multiple trajectories of self-control using Latent Class Growth Models: more than 89% improving over time. In addition, patients with Cluster C personality disorders showed greater improvement in coping skills. Patients showing less improvement in impulsivity had greater rates of crime and recidivism. We conclude that self-control can be influenced by interventions or treatment, and that both starting values and trajectories of self-control provide valuable information. Interestingly, the associations between self-control and psychopathology, crime and recidivism were not as strong as reported in other populations.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0093854819856051,
Can Women Shelters Help Reduce Symptoms of PTSD and C-PTSD? Trajectories of PTSD Symptom Development Following Partner- and Family-Related Violence,"Background: To protect women from Intimate partner violence (IPV), women’s shelters should not only provide emergency safety from IPV exposure, but also prolonged support that empowers women to build a life free from violence. The present study aims to investigate individual symptom development in association with residency at a women’s shelter. Method: Data were collected at four different timepoints, that is, enrolment (T1, N = 150), 3-months residency (T2, = 110), 6-months residency (T3, N = 68) and after relocation (T4, N = 63). Women were included from four Danish women’s shelters. The International Trauma Questionnaire (ITQ) was applied to test for post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and Complex-PTSD (C-PTSD) at all timepoints. A paired sample t-test was used to test the mean symptom development, and a Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) was applied to test for different classes of PTSD-trajectories. Logistic regression was applied to predict class membership from shelter-related variables and symptom severity, that is, length of residency, psychological counselling, revictimization and key symptoms of C-PTSD. Results: The prevalence of PTSD (31%) and C-PTSD (37.9%) was high at enrolment. Although t-tests suggested a significant decline in symptoms at follow-up, the LCGA revealed different classes of symptom development. The two-class model was found to be the best representation of data with low-symptom- and high-symptom profiles, respectively. Overall, the largest decline in symptoms occurred within the first 3 months of residency. Revictimization was high and was further found to predict class membership. However, when included in a multiple regression only symptom severity predicted the high-symptoms profile class. Discussion: Psychological treatment focussing on PTSD and C-PTSD is important for the women’s future well-being and safety. Reports on revictimization was alarmingly high, which emphasises a continuing need to protect women from psychological violence within the shelters. These findings should be replicated in larger samples before we can draw any conclusion.",https://doi.org/10.1177/08862605211066568,
Longitudinal Trajectory of Exposure to Psychological Interpersonal Violence,"Psychological intimate partner violence (P-IPV) refers to verbal abuse from one partner to another and abuse of power or control from one partner to another. To date, no studies have examined the longitudinal course of P-IPV exposure among mothers or the effect that witnessing P-IPV can have on their children. Using latent class growth analysis, the current study identified five trajectory groups with the following intercept and growth characteristics: low stable, low-increasing, moderate-decreasing, high-decreasing, and consistently elevated. Membership in the four groups characterized by higher P-IPV exposure was predicted by maternal race and exposure to physical abuse. The children of mothers in the low-increasing and consistently elevated groups had elevated scores on the Internalizing and Externalizing scales of the Childhood Behavior Checklist. These findings remained after controlling for child sex, race, cumulative trauma exposure, and maternal depression.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260517707309,
The Impact of Life Domains on Developmental Trajectories of Peer Delinquency among Korean Adolescents: A Partial Test of Agnew’s General Theory of Crime and Delinquency with a Group-Based Trajectory Modeling Approach,"Agnew introduced a new integrated theory; the General Theory of Crime and Delinquency, in which he attempted to corral the most influential predictors of criminal behavior into more parsimonious propositions of multiple life domains-self, family, peer, school, and work-as well as constraints against crime and motivations for it. This study presents a partial test of the theory using longitudinal data of 2,351 Korean adolescents. A group-based modeling approach (latent class growth analysis) was run to examine direct effects of life domains on peer delinquency as well as mediating effects of constraints and motivation on their relationships. The study identified three subgroups: early onset/decreasing (3.2%), moderate (12.4%), and low/none (84.4%). The findings revealed that the self and peer domains exhibited a positive impact on the early onset/decreasing trajectory group compared to the low/none group with the constraint exhibiting a negative impact. The moderate trajectory group demonstrated that the self-domain was significant but was not rendered insignificant after controlling for constraints and motivations. The study provided moderate support for life domains within Agnew's new theory for peer delinquency in nonwestern countries.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0306624x211016326,
"Trajectories of Posttraumatic Stress and Depression in Police and Community Members Following the Violence during Civil Unrest in Ferguson, Missouri","Abstract Longitudinal research following discreet traumatic events reveals distinct symptom trajectories in untreated survivors of trauma. Trajectories within communities exposed to shared, prolonged violence involving subgroups differing in perspectives, and roles during the event have not been studied. This study examined trajectories of posttraumatic stress (PTS) and depressive symptoms secondary to exposure to violence during civil unrest in citizens ( n = 311) and law enforcement ( n = 255) over 1.5 years following exposure. Latent class growth modeling was used to examine trajectories of PTS and depressive symptoms. Four‐class quadratic solutions for both PTS and depressive symptoms demonstrated best fit. Similar patterns emerged for such that most participants were classified as resistant (57% and 67%, respectively), followed by resilience (23.8% and 17.2%), chronic (12.6% and 12.0%), and worsening (6.1% and 4.4%). When all predictors were entered in a single model, race, and membership in citizen or law enforcement groups did not distinguish trajectories of recovery. Higher income and social support emerged as consistent protective factors against PTS and depressive symptoms, while trauma history emerged as a risk factor for PTS. Women were more at risk for depressive symptoms only. Implications for improving police/civilian relations in Ferguson, Missouri, and other communities are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ajcp.12273,
Insomnia symptom trajectories among adult survivors of childhood sexual abuse: A longitudinal study,"Childhood sexual abuse (CSA) is associated with sleep disturbances in adulthood. However, longitudinal studies have yet to identify among CSA-survivors subgroups distinguished by the trajectory of their insomnia severity, or predictors of subgroup membership. The objective of this study was to examine longitudinal insomnia symptom trajectories, as well as predictors and correlates of the identified trajectories, over a 4 year study period in a sample of adult, mainly female CSA-survivors. The sample comprised 533 adult survivors of CSA (94.9% women, mean age 39.2 years, mean age of abuse onset 6.5 years), recruited from support centers for sexual abuse survivors in Norway. Latent class growth analyses were used to identify insomnia symptom trajectories. Three distinct trajectories of insomnia symptoms were identified; one characterized by high insomnia symptom scores minimally decreasing over the study period ('high and decreasing', 30.6%), one characterized by stable intermediate insomnia symptom scores ('intermediate and stable', 41.5%), and one characterized by stable low insomnia symptom scores ('low and stable', 27.9%). Predictors of belonging to the high and decreasing trajectory (using the low and stable trajectory as a reference), was lower age of abuse onset (expotentiated coefficient (EC): 0.93, p = 0.026), abuse involving penetration (EC: 2.36, p = 0.005), threats (EC: 3.06, p < 0.001) or physical violence (EC: 3.29 p < 0.001), a higher score on a composite variable comprising multiple other abuse and perpetrator aspects (EC: 2.55, p < 0.001), as well as scoring above a clinical cut-off on a measure of posttraumatic stress symptoms (EC: 12.17, p < 0.001). Those belonging to the high and decreasing trajectory also reported lower levels of perceived social support and higher levels of subjectively experienced relational difficulties compared to those belonging to the two other trajectories. We conclude that different longitudinal insomnia trajectories exist among adult CSA survivors. The overall results, as well as the significant predictors, are discussed alongside their potential clinical implications.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.05.009,
"Trajectories of stressful life events and long-term changes in mental health outcomes, moderated by family functioning? the TRAILS study","We assessed the association between trajectories of stressful life events (SLEs) throughout adolescence and changes in mental health from childhood to young adulthood. Further, we assessed whether family functioning moderated this association.Data of the first six waves of the TRAILS study (2001-2016; n = 2229) were used, a cohort followed from approximately age 11 to 23. We measured SLEs (death of a family member or other beloved one, delinquency, moving, victim of violence, parental divorce, and sexual harassment) at ages 14, 16 and 19. Family functioning was measured at all six time points using the Family Assessment Device (FAD), and mental health was measured through the Youth/Adult Self-Report at ages 11 and 23. Latent class growth analyses (LCGA) were used to examine longitudinal trajectories and associations.We identified three SLE trajectories (low, middle, high) throughout adolescence, and found no significant associations between these trajectories and changes in mental health from childhood to young adulthood. Family functioning and SLE trajectories were significantly associated, however, the association of SLE trajectories and changes in mental health was not modified by family functioning. Mental health problems at age 11 increased the likelihood of high SLE trajectories during adolescence, and of experiencing negative family functioning.Experiencing SLEs throughout adolescence does not have a direct impact on changes in mental health from childhood to young adulthood, but early adolescence mental health problems increase the likelihood of experiencing SLEs.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-022-00544-0,
Specific theories of crime? A longitudinal assessment of the competing effects of psychopathy and self-control,"The association between psychopathic personality traits (PPTs) and offending behavior has been studied extensively. Self-control also enjoys strong empirical support in its association with antisocial behavior. Further, research has shown that those with higher PPTs and those with lower self-control are more likely to be antisocial and are more likely to have protracted criminal careers. The current study used latent class growth analysis to compare how PPTs and self-control predict membership in longitudinal offending trajectories among an all-male sample of adjudicated delinquents (n = 726) from the Pathways to Desistance data. The results indicated that PPTs predicted membership across the persistent offending and desisting groups more often than self-control. Self-control, however, more often predicted membership within the persistent offending groups. Although both factors were among the most salient predictors of group membership, the results illustrated specific differences in how each factor can influence longitudinal patterns of offending.",https://doi.org/10.1080/0735648x.2020.1727765,
Trajectories of traumatic stress reactions in children exposed to intimate partner violence,"Understanding different longitudinal patterns of traumatic stress reactions in children exposed to intimate partner violence (IPV) can promote early identification of at-risk children.Our study aims to explore trajectories of traumatic stress reactions following childhood IPV exposure, and their relation with parental traumatic stress and child emotional security in the interparental subsystem.The sample comprised 303 children (age 3-10, M = 6.20) from families referred to institutions for IPV. Data were collected at home.Three waves of parent-reported questionnaire data were analyzed using latent class growth analysis and linear regression.Five trajectories were identified: 'resilient', 'moderate stable', 'struggling', 'improving', and 'elevated adjusting'. Only the 'struggling' trajectory had dysfunctional symptom levels at the final wave. Higher parental traumatic stress predicted 'improving' trajectory membership (β = 0.17, p = .033), whereas lower parental traumatic stress (β = -0.20, p = .003) and child emotional insecurity (β = -0.45, p = < .001) predicted 'resilient' trajectory membership. Higher child emotional insecurity predicted membership in trajectories with higher initial traumatic stress (improving: β = 0.26, p < .001; struggling: β = 0.31, p < .001; elevated adjusting: β = 0.27, p < .001). Child emotional security did not buffer the effect of parental traumatic stress on likelihood of dysfunctional trajectory membership (β = 0.04, p =.380).Children exposed to IPV show different trajectories of traumatic stress reactions, partly corresponding to trajectories identified in other populations. Child emotional security and parental traumatic stress predict trajectory membership.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2019.04.017,
The Prevalence Rate of Sexual Violence Worldwide: A Trend Analysis,"Abstract Background: The purpose of the present study is to showcase the image of Sexual Violence (SV) temporal trends through exploring differences in its prevalence rates during 1990-2017 across 195 countries and territories. Methods: The SV prevalence rates were derived from the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) database during 1990-2017, worldwide. First, the Latent Growth Model (LGM) was employed for assessing the change in SV prevalence rate over time in Asia, Africa, Europe, North America, South America, Australia &amp; Oceania, for men and women separately. Then, the change in SV prevalence rate over time was determined within countries with high and low Human Development Index (HDI). Finally, the Latent Growth Mixture Models (LGMM) were applied for identifying classes where countries within each class have similar trend of SV prevalence rate over time. Results: The SV prevalence was higher among women than men and decreased in both genders over time across the world. The declining trend in SV prevalence against men is visible in both countries with high and low HDI, but SV prevalence against women in countries with low HDI shows an increase. The findings of LGMM identified six classes of SV prevalence trajectories. LGMM allocated Bermuda into the class with the highest decrease in SV prevalence against men, and Equatorial Guinea and Luxembourg into the class with the highest increase. Other countries had very slow declining trends. In terms of SV prevalence against women, LGMM allocated China, North Korea, and Taiwan into the class with the most increase among the countries in the world. Bermuda, Guyana, Mexico, Nigeria, and Saint Lucia were placed into the class which witnessed the largest decline and Angola, Congo, and Equatorial Guinea were ranked next. The trend in other countries was mostly decreasing. Conclusion: Given the high economic and social burden that SV has on victims and societies, the rate of SV in most countries does not seem to have dropped remarkably and requires special attention by relevant policymakers. The SV prevalence rate is highly heterogeneous among world countries which may be due to the definitions and tools used, and more importantly, the culture norms.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-37137/v3,
Differential impact of <scp>COVID</scp>‐related lockdown on mental health in Germany,"The World Health Organization declared COVID-19 outbreak a global pandemic on March 11, 2020. Following the rapid and uncontrollable course of the pandemic, many governments decided to massively restrict public and private life to prevent further spread of the virus. Especially the measures to enforce “physical distancing” during the “lockdown” can be seen as a global macro-stressor affecting a major part of mankind in an unprecedented manner. Lockdown can have manifold psychosocial consequences, including unemployment and precarious economic situations, marital and familial discord, and domestic violence. Subsequent psychological responses, such as feelings of loneliness, anger or preoccupation about the future, are likely. This was picked up by mass media as well as expertse.g., 1, warning the public about possible negative effects of the lockdown on mental health. While many speculations and hypothetical considerations arose, there is a paucity of empirical real-world data. Initial ad-hoc studies have been conducted quickly, reporting high incidence of negative mental health outcomes, such as depression and anxietye.g., 2. Thereby, reports inferred detrimental consequences for the mental state of the general population. However, those studies have several shortcomings. Most of them applied cross-sectional designs, which may capture very transient symptoms rather than long-lasting fluctuations in men­tal states, and do not allow comparison with pre-lockdown mea­sures. Also, the questionnaires that were used are often only screening tools rather than in-depth assessment instruments. In contrast, more meaningful insights can be gathered from longitudinal studies built on continuous, detailed assessments of mental health before and during the lockdown. We present here extensive data on behavioral and mental health changes in relation to the lockdown of public life in Germany. We capitalize on a population-based, prospective, longitudinal cohort study termed LORA (Longitudinal Resilience Assessment3), conducted in the Rhine-Main region since 2017. Its main aim is investigating resilience – i.e., the ability to maintain mental health despite difficult life circumstances – in initially healthy adults (assessed by the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview4). After an extensive baseline evaluation, major life events, micro-stressors in the form of daily hassles, and mental health status (primary outcome, assessed by the German version of the General Health Questionnaire, GHQ-285) are recorded every three months using an online monitoring system. The pandemic and the lockdown during the ongoing study provided a unique natural experiment for investigating how initially mentally healthy subjects respond to a major macro-stressor. Lockdown started in Germany on March 22 and was gradually relaxed from May 6 onwards. We immediately increased the sampling rate of our LORA study to once per week, the first assessment taking place on March 31. Ethical approval was obtained from the ethical review boards of the University Hospitals of Mainz and Frankfurt. Data presented here are from the first eight weeks of the weekly assessments, compared to the last measurement time point in LORA prior to lockdown. Almost half of the overall sample (N=523) contributed data; this sample was not significantly different from the complete initial one. The sample consisted of 69% females, and had a mean age of 31.5±8.4 years. Among participants, 47.8% were cohabitating with a partner and 22.8% had children under 18 years; 40.9% were working full-time and another 34.8% were studying or undergoing a professional training. Six participants were positively tested for SARS-CoV-2 since mid-March, and 57 had to undergo strict quarantine. As much as 362 participants worked and studied from home during lockdown. Overall, the number of daily hassles per week decreased from an average of 60.0±27.2 prior to the lockdown to 41.2±22.3 at week 8. This decrease was significant when comparing pre-lockdown values to those at weeks 1-4 (t508=13.5, p<0.001) and weeks 5-8 (t475=17.7, p<0.001). Parallel to this, mental health status significantly improved over the entire post-lockdown period, indicated by a decrease of GHQ-28 mean values from 20.5±9.7 before lockdown to 16.8±7.6 averaged across weeks 1-4 (t508=7.8, p<0.001), and to 16.2±7.1 averaged across weeks 5-8 (t474=8.8, p<0.001). A quadratic latent growth mixture model revealed the existence of three subpopulations among the study sample, with distinct mental health trajectories from pre-lockdown through week 8 of the assessment. Group 1 (8.3% of the sample, mean age 28.0±5.9 years, 86.8% female) showed high initial mental dysfunction values, that increased until week 3 and then decreased, returning to the baseline level by week 6 of the assessment. Group 2 (83.6% of the sample, mean age 31.7±8.5, 66.7% female) maintained or improved their mental health during the entire assessment period. Group 3 (8.1% of the sample, mean age 32.7±9.2, 73.7% female) significantly deteriorated in mental health from week 3 onwards. The overall reduced amount of daily hassles and increase of mental health scores is, at first sight, counterintuitive. However, our analyses revealed subpopulations differentially affected by the pandemic. For Groups 1 and 2, the lockdown measures resulted in reduced mundane stress-inducing factors, such as less commuting or reduced workload. Thus, these groups experienced a short-term reduction of micro-stressors. However, in our sample of initially mentally healthy participants, we identified a susceptible group, whose mental health deteriorated over the course of the assessment. The existence of this “vulnerable group” may explain the rise in mental disorders seen in some cross-sectional studies: while the majority of people cope well with the consequences of the pandemic (at least if the economic impact is buffered against), a subgroup of individuals is susceptible to adversities and develops mental health problems. Vulnerability towards such lockdown effects might be higher in people already suffering from psychiatric disorders, or in elderly populations with impoverished social networks. Indeed, Group 1 of our study had significantly younger participants than the other two (F2,520=4.0, p=0.02). Further, it is likely that socioeconomic challenges and risk factors such as unemployment or poverty, less powerful in Germany than in many other countries, will have later negative influences. Our results indicate that unspecific, general interventions may not be the optimal response to lockdown measures. Resources should rather be allocated to early identification and support of particularly vulnerable individuals in times of crisis. Future studies should quantify risk and especially protective factors playing a role in coping with the stressors of the current pandemic, followed by tailored interventions targeting the identified factors in susceptible individuals to prevent the manifestation of mental disorders. In sum, we refute the undifferentiated view that lockdown per se has a negative effect on mental health. Rather, it affects a vulnerable group of individuals, while the vast majority of people remain healthy or even improve their mental well-being, as everyday stressors are reduced.",https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20830,

Early co-occurrence of peer victimization and aggression,"Abstract An accelerated longitudinal research design was used to examine heterogeneity in the developmental co-occurrence of peer relational victimization and aggression and of peer overt victimization and aggression from age 4.5 to 10.5 years. Data were gathered from four cohorts of children in kindergarten to Grade 3 ( N = 503) on six occasions across 2 years. Psychopathology, peer, and social–cognitive factors were examined as predictors of the joint trajectories. Sequential process latent growth mixture models identified four distinct subgroups for the relational trajectories (co-occurring increasing aggression, co-occurring increasing victimization, high chronic victimization, typical low risk) and four distinct subgroups for the overt trajectories (co-occurring decelerating aggression, high chronic victimization, moderate chronic victimization, typical low risk). Membership in the co-occurring trajectories was associated with psychopathology and membership in the chronic victimization trajectories was related to internalizing and social–cognitive problems but also peer likeability.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579421000523,

We examined homophobic bullying victimization trajectories among high school students ( N = 3,064; M age = 13.67; Girls = 50.2%) and how these developmental pathways vary as a function of factors like homophobic bullying perpetration, sex assigned at birth, and sexuality. Using data from a 3‐wave longitudinal investigation over a 2‐year period, we utilized latent growth mixture modeling to explore the aforementioned trajectories. Findings suggested that there were three distinct classes characterized by high initial rates and declines over time, low initial rates, and increases over time, and low, stable, rate across time.

This study aimed to identify the profile of adolescents in conflict with the law based on the Social Maladjustment (SM) construct, to describe patterns of criminal conducts, and to verify the continuity and change on these variables, in a longitudinal prospective study. A sample of 78 adolescents answered to the Jesness Inventory - revised in Brazil and to the Questionnaire of Youth Behaviors, at two collection times (W1 and W2). The profiles were identified with latent class growth analysis and the behavior patterns were compared with Student’s t test. Two classes were obtained: High SM and Normative SM. At W1, SM high scores were associated to high frequency in the perpetration of crimes and both classes had lower SM at W2.

"Child community violence exposure in an at-risk sample: Developmental trajectories, caregiving risks, and the role of child temperament.","To better understand early etiological pathways to trajectories of child exposure to community violence (CECV), we used person-centered latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to examine chronicity of CECV from early school age through early adolescence, and examined early risks of the identified CECV trajectories (i.e., prenatal cocaine exposure, harsh parenting and caregiving instability across infancy and early childhood, and child activity level and inhibitory control at kindergarten age).An at-risk sample (N = 216; 110 girls) of primarily low-income participants (76% on Temporary Assistance for Needy Families) with high rates of prenatal substance exposure was used. The majority of the mothers were African American (72%), had high school or below education (70%), and were single (86%). Postnatal assessments occurred at eight time points during infancy and toddlerhood, early childhood through early school age, and early adolescence.We identified two distinct linearly increasing CECV trajectories (high-exposure and low-exposure). An interaction between child activity level and maternal harshness emerged, such that children with high activity levels and experiencing high harshness had the highest probabilities of being in the high exposure-increasing trajectory, in addition to early caregiving instability (conditional effect).The current findings not only have important theoretical implications but also provide insights into early intervention.",https://doi.org/10.1037/vio0000416,
Perinatal and early-life factors associated with stable and unstable trajectories of psychopathic traits across childhood,"Abstract Background This study aimed to identify perinatal and early-life factors associated with trajectories of psychopathic traits across childhood. Methods Participants were 1631 children (51.5% girls) from the Quebec Longitudinal Study of Child Development. A wide range of perinatal and early - life factors were assessed from pregnancy to age 2.5 years using medical files and mothers’ reports. Psychopathic traits were assessed via teachers’ reports at ages 6, 7, 8, 10, and 12 years. Latent class growth analyses and multinomial logistic regressions controlling for child sex were conducted. Two-way interaction effects between perinatal/early-life factors and child sex were explored. Results Four trajectories of psychopathic traits were identified: High-stable (4.48%), Increasing (8.77%), Decreasing (11.46%), and Low-stable (75.29%). A few perinatal factors and most child-level and family-level early-life factors significantly increased the odds of following the High-stable v. the Low-stable trajectory. Higher levels of psychotropic exposures during pregnancy, socioeconomic adversity, child's physical aggression, child's opposition, mother's depressive symptoms, and hostile parenting increased the likelihood of following the Increasing instead of the Low-stable trajectory. Higher socioeconomic adversity, mother's depressive symptoms, and inconsistent parenting were associated with membership to the High-stable instead of the Decreasing trajectory. Most associations were not moderated by child sex. Conclusions These results shed light on the perinatal and early-life factors that are associated with specific pathways of psychopathic traits during childhood and suggest that different factors could be targeted to prevent the exacerbation ( v. low and stable levels) or the stability at high levels ( v. attenuation) of these traits.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291721001586,
Explaining the Patterns of Bullying Victimization Trajectories: Assessing the Generality of Low Self-Control and Crime Opportunity Models to Bullying Victims,"This study hypothesizes that self-control and opportunity variables affect heterogeneity in developmental trajectories of bullying victimization. Using data from a follow-up study of 2,351 Korean adolescents, the study incorporates a latent class growth analysis approach to identify subgroups, each with a unique pattern of the trajectories. The model yields three subgroups of bullying victims: the early-onset and decreaser, the increaser and late-peak, and the normative groups. Results suggest that, compared to the normative group, the early-onset and decreasing group members manifest lower levels of self-control and engage in a greater range of delinquent behaviors. Also, the impact of low self-control on group membership was attenuated after controlling for those opportunity variables, indicating a partially mediating relationship. Social guardianship variables distinguished normative groups from other victim groups. Further, members of the increaser and late-peak group were more likely than the early-onset and decreaser group members to engage in cyber deviance over the long-term.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0306624x221102793,
Trajectories of delinquency among young adult prisoners,"Using latent class growth analysis, this prospective longitudinal study aimed to identify different trajectories of delinquency among prisoners ( N = 2352) of youth correctional facilities. Criminal behaviour was monitored with crime register data on individuals from ages 14 to 25. Analyses revealed four developmental pathways: early- and late-starting desisters (31.8 percent and 5.2 percent, respectively) and early- and late-starting persisters (21.2 percent and 41.8 percent, respectively). The effects of potential risk and protective factors from multiple domains (individual, family, peer and social factors) were analysed with analyses of variance and χ² tests for each of the distinct trajectory groups. The quantity of risk factors was higher throughout the observation period in the persisting groups. Cumulative disadvantages could often be found in the persistent trajectories when low social bonds and low commitment to social norms persisted until (early) adulthood. Similarly, higher social capital and social competencies were more prevalent among offenders who desisted from crime, regardless of the severity of their offences committed as adolescents.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1477370819877769,
Developmental trajectories of toddler sleep problems: can a person-centered approach help identify children at risk?,"Previous research examining toddler sleep problems has relied almost exclusively on variable-centered statistical approaches to analyze these data, which provide helpful information about the development of the average child. The current study examined whether person-centered trajectory analysis, a statistical technique that can identify subgroups of children who differ in their initial level and/or trajectory of sleep problems, has the potential to inform our understanding of toddler sleep problems and their development. Families (N = 185) were assessed at 12, 24, 30, and 36 months of child age. Latent class growth analysis was used to test for subgroups that differed in their 24-36 month sleep problems. Subgroups were compared on child 36-month externalizing, internalizing, and total problem behaviors, and on 12 month maternal mental health, inter-parental conflict, and maternal parenting behaviors. Results support a four-class solution, with ""low, stable,"" ""low, increasing,"" ""high, increasing,"" and ""high decreasing"" classes. The classes whose sleep problems persisted or worsened over time had worse behavioral problems than those whose symptoms improved or remained stably low. Additionally, 12 month maternal depression and global symptom severity, intimate partner violence, and maternal harsh-intrusive parenting behaviors discriminated between the classes that had similar levels of 24 month sleep disturbance but who had diverging trajectories over time. This statistical approach appears to have the potential to increase understanding of sleep problem trajectories in the early years of life. Maternal mental health, intimate partner violence, and parenting behaviors may be clinically useful markers of risk for the persistence or development of toddler sleep problems.",https://doi.org/10.1093/sleep/zsac142,
"“Wild Years”: Rock Music, Problem Behaviors and Mental Well-being in Adolescence and Young Adulthood","Adolescent preferences for non-mainstream types of rock music can be markers of adolescent problem behaviors, but no study has ever investigated whether this relationship continues into adulthood. In a six-wave study, 900 Dutch adolescents were followed from ages 12 to 21 (Mage T1 12.4, 51.1% girls), while reporting on depressive symptoms, mental well-being, aggression and drug use. A latent class growth analysis on their preferences for specific types of rock music revealed four fan groups. When these fan groups were compared to one another, in adolescence, the all-out rock fans displayed the highest peak in depressive symptoms and the lowest dip in well-being and the rock/metal fans reported the most aggression. And for both these groups, drug use increased at the onset of adulthood. Pop fans displayed a profile characterized by low depressive symptoms and aggression, and high in mental well-being. Finally, the popular rock fans held an in-between position between pop fans, on one side, and the all-out rock fans and rock/metal fans, on the other side. Thus, music preferences can be markers of problems, not only in adolescence but also in young adulthood. Still, music can enhance mood, helps to cope with problems, and peers in fan groups can provide support. This research focuses on the relationship between music and problem behaviors, specifically among members of the all-out rock fans and rock/metal fans, but many of these young people might have had more personal problems if they had not had their music and their fan-group peers.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-021-01505-0,
An evaluation of dual systems theories of adolescent delinquency in a normative longitudinal cohort study of youth,"Purpose: Dual systems theories of adolescent risk-taking propose that the socioemotional and self-regulation systems develop at different rates, resulting in a peak in sensation-seeking in adolescence at a time when self-regulation abilities are not yet fully mature. This ‘developmental imbalance’ between bottom-up drives for reward and top-down control is proposed to create a period of vulnerability for high-risk behaviours such as delinquency, substance use, unprotected sex, and reckless driving. However, as recently noted by Meisel et al. (2019), almost no studies have tested this hypothesis directly owing to a lack of studies that have exploited longitudinal data to construct developmental measures of imbalance. Methods: In this study, we use data from the longitudinal z-proso study (n=1522) to test whether the presence of a developmental imbalance between sensation-seeking and self-regulation is associated with levels of engagement in delinquency across early adolescence to adulthood. Results: Using a latent class growth analysis of sensation-seeking, self-regulation and delinquency, we found that a model with 3-classes was optimal in the whole sample and male sub-sample, including one class characterised by a developmental imbalance and corresponding adolescent peak in delinquency. In females, we found no evidence for a class that could be described according to the trajectories hypothesised in dual systems theory.Conclusions: Results support the claim that a developmental imbalance may drive an adolescent increase in delinquency, but only for a small subgroup of individuals, particularly males.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/k2gwt,
Impacts of psychopathic traits dimensions on the development of indirect aggression from childhood to adolescence.,"Children who show elevated levels of indirect aggression (IA) from childhood to adolescence are at increased risks of experiencing detrimental outcomes. Some studies suggest that psychopathic traits could act as a predisposing vulnerability in the development of IA, but the contributions of all three dimensions of psychopathic traits in explaining developmental trajectories of IA from childhood to adolescence remain unclear. This study aimed to determine if the three dimensions of psychopathic traits during childhood (i.e., callous-unemotional, narcissism-grandiosity, and impulsivity-irresponsibility at 6-9 years old) increase the risk of following a high IA trajectory across preadolescence, and whether sex moderated these associations. Participants were 744 children (47% girls; 93% born in Quebec, Canada, and over 50% from low socioeconomic backgrounds) assessed annually over 5 years. Approximately half of them (n = 370; 40.3% girls) were referred to school-based services for conduct problems (CP) at study intake. Latent class growth analyses revealed four developmental trajectories of IA, which were regressed on psychopathic traits dimensions using a three-step approach. After adjusting for demographic confounders, CP, and other dimensions of psychopathic traits, only narcissism-grandiosity traits significantly predicted memberships to a high and stable trajectory of IA use. The associations between the other dimensions of psychopathic traits and IA trajectories were not significant when considering confounders. No moderating effects by child sex were observed. These results suggest that narcissism-grandiosity traits could be of use for clinicians aiming to detect children most at risk of showing high and persistent levels of IA.

Identification of Multisystemic Therapy (MST) Subgroups with Distinct Trajectories on Ultimate Outcomes in Norway,"The effect of Multisystemic Therapy (MST) treatment for serious behavior problems among adolescents has been established through multiple studies. However, variations across individuals should also be examined to better understand how MST works or for whom. In this study, we explored and identified subgroups of youth with serious problems in Norway regarding their responses to MST in terms of ultimate MST outcomes (e.g., living at home, abstaining from violence) over time. We further explored whether immigrant background, in addition to gender and age of the youth at intake, predicted belonging to the subgroups. Data came from 1674 adolescents (MeanAge = 14.55, SDAge = 1.58; 60.7% boys) and their families referred to MST treatment by the municipal Child Welfare Services for serious and persistent antisocial behavior. The outcomes were assessed at five time-points from intake to 18-months after discharge for youth and families who completed the treatment. Latent class growth analyses revealed heterogeneous trajectories regarding youths' responses to MST. Results indicated a high and sustained degree of improvement across the ultimate outcomes for the vast majority of the youths. However, there was still variation in the groups, with improvement and deterioration trajectories for various outcomes. Most of these trajectories were predicted by gender and youth's age at intake, but not by immigrant status. Not every youth-at-risk responds similarly to MST, and more studies examining heterogeneity will help us to identify factors to be targeted to better tailor the MST interventions for youth with serious problems.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-020-00735-3,
Patterns of Change in Dynamic Risk Factors over Time in Youth Offenders,"Risk assessments that include dynamic risk factors are increasingly being utilized within the youth justice system to predict a young person’s likelihood to reoffend, to assist with case management, and to better inform intervention services. However, most studies to date have relied solely on single-wave cross-sectional research designs that essentially treat dynamic risk factors as static. Thus, it is unclear whether and how putative dynamic risk factors change over time, a question that has significant implications for assessment and case management policy and practice. Using a widely used and validated risk assessment and case management instrument (the Youth Level of Service/Case Management Inventory), the purpose of the present study was to examine whether the dynamic risk factors outlined in the Risk-Need-Responsivity (RNR) model do in fact change over time and, if so, to investigate the effect of youth-specific predictors on these changes. Two hundred youth offenders were tracked from their first risk assessment conducted at probation to their transition out of the youth justice system. Results from generalized linear mixed modelling (GLMM) and latent class growth modelling (LCGM) analyses indicated that most dynamic risk domain scores increased over time, but that there was significant individual variation among youth at initial status and in the rate of change. Even when controlling for youth-specific factors, youth who were lower risk at the time of initial assessment increased in risk at a greater rate than higher-risk youth. Results have implications for the RNR framework, for improving the accuracy of risk assessments, and for informing treatment implementation.",https://doi.org/10.3138/cjccj.2018-0001,

Are adverse childhood experiences associated with trajectories of healthy aging? Evidence from China,"Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) have life-course impact and may be associated with healthy ageing. This study aimed to explore the association between ACEs and healthy aging trajectories among middle- and older-aged adults in China. The data were obtained from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study from 2011 to 2018. A total of 8906 respondents were enrolled in the analysis. Through latent growth mixture model, five categories of healthy ageing trajectories, defined as 'stable type with high starting point', 'stable type at the middle level', 'stable type with low starting point', 'rapid descending type with high starting point', and 'stable descending type with medium starting point' were identified. Based on multinomial logistic regression, ACEs were significantly associated with healthy aging trajectories (stable type at the middle level/stable type with high starting point: relative risk reduction [RRR] = 1.19; P < 0.01; 95% CI = 1.16–1.23; stable type with low starting point/stable type with high starting point: RRR = 1.35; P < 0.01; 95%CI = 1.21–1.51; rapid descending type with high starting point/stable type with high starting point: RRR = 1.09; P < 0.1; 95% CI = 0.99–1.19; and stable descending type with medium starting point/stable type with high starting point: RRR = 1.30; P < 0.01; 95% CI = 1.23–1.38). When treating ACEs as a categorical variable, the healthy aging trajectory of the rapid descending type with a high starting point was not affected by any ACE groups. Further analysis of the relationship between each ACE and the trajectories of healthy aging reveals that parental disability, household mental illness, domestic violence, physical abuse, unsafe neighbourhood and bullying had significant impacts on almost every developmental trajectory of unhealthy aging. The government should promote the realisation of healthy aging from the perspective of the entire population and life cycle, intervene early in life, avoid the occurrence of ACEs as much as possible, and minimise the harm done by ACEs as much as possible.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ssmph.2023.101501,
"Longitudinal modeling in developmental neuroimaging research: Common challenges, and solutions from developmental psychology","Hypotheses about change over time are central to informing our understanding of development. Developmental neuroscience is at critical juncture: although the majority of longitudinal imaging studies have observations with two time points, researchers are increasingly obtaining three or more observations of the same individuals. The goals of the proposed manuscript are to draw upon the long history of methodological and applied literature on longitudinal statistical models to summarize common problems and issues that arise in their use. We also provide suggestions and solutions to improve the design, analysis and interpretation of longitudinal data, and discuss the importance of matching the theory of change with the appropriate statistical model used to test the theory. Researchers should articulate a clear theory of change and to design studies to capture that change and use appropriately sensitive measures to assess that change during development. Simulated data are used to demonstrate several common analytic approaches to longitudinal analyses. We provide the code for our simulations and figures in an online supplement to aid researchers in exploring and plotting their data. We provide brief examples of best practices for reporting such models. Finally, we clarify common misunderstandings in the application and interpretation of these analytic approaches.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2017.11.009,
Adolescent Abstention From Delinquency: Examining the Mediating Role of Time Spent With (Delinquent) Peers,"Research consistently identifies a group of adolescents who refrain from minor delinquency entirely. Known as abstainers , studying these adolescents is an underexplored approach to understanding adolescent minor delinquency. In this paper, we tested hypotheses regarding adolescent delinquency abstention derived from the developmental taxonomy model and social control theory in 497 adolescents (283 boys) aged 13–18 comparing three groups of adolescents: abstainers, experimenters, and a delinquent group. We found that the relation between adolescent abstention and personal characteristics (i.e., conscientiousness and anxiety) was (partially) mediated by the amount of time spent with peers. Furthermore, the level of best friend delinquency moderated the relation between time spent with peers and delinquency abstention. Results support aspects of both theoretical frameworks.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jora.12246,
Trajectories of Criminal Behavior Across the Life Course,"This chapter provides an overview of developmental-typological theories of criminal behavior best known by criminologists. These theories aim to explain heterogeneity in intra-individual change in criminal behavior across the life course by postulating developmental trajectories differing in terms of onset, variety and frequency of offending, criminal career duration, and period of desistance. The chapter outlines the most popular statistical methods for modeling developmental trajectories. It also summarizes the empirical findings from available developmental trajectory research. Overall, available longitudinal studies tend to support only some postulates of developmental-typological theories. This chapter thus proposes a number of directions for future research and provides some concluding insights.",https://doi.org/10.1093/oxfordhb/9780190201371.013.7,
Symptom Trajectory among Formerly Abused Women: An Exploratory Study,"Women who have experienced intimate partner violence suffer from symptoms that persist long after the abuse has ended. However, the patterns and trajectory of these symptoms are poorly understood. The objective of this longitudinal research was to explore symptom trajectory typologies. A latent class growth analysis with multi-outcomes modeling was used to explore typologies based on women’s (N = 30) trajectories over 4 months. Two distinct symptom typologies were identified: (1) consistently lessening symptom group (n = 16); (2) moderately worsening symptom group (n = 14).

A longitudinal analysis on determinants of problem drinking among Korean women: focusing on a gender perspective,"In recent years, female drinking has been on the rise worldwide, and this trend can be observed in Korea as well. Accordingly, this study aimed to examine the heterogeneous longitudinal changes in drinking patterns among Korean women, while also exploring the determinants of these changes. In particular, the study identified the gender perspective-related determinants of the classified patterns of problem drinking.Data on 4615 adult women who participated in the Korea Welfare Panel Study (KOWEPS) for 3 years (2018-2020) were analyzed longitudinally using SPSS Statistics 22.0 and M-plus 7.0. The changes in female drinking patterns were analyzed using latent class growth analysis. Subsequently, multinomial logistic regression analysis was performed to identify the predictive factors affecting the changes in drinking patterns.Latent class analysis yielded three classes: ""low problem drinking/decreased,"" ""moderate problem drinking/maintained,"" and ""high problem drinking/increased."" Of the participants, 80.4% were in the first class, 14.5% in the second, and 5.1% in the third. After controlling for sociodemographic and psychosocial factors, we found: i) domestic violence, work-family balance stress, and gender role perception were not statistically significant for the ""moderate problem drinking/maintained"" class; lower levels of depression (odds ratio; OR = .750, p < .05) and higher levels of satisfaction with social relationships (OR = 1.257, p < .05) increased the probability of belonging to the ""moderate problem drinking/maintained"" group compared to the low problem drinking/decreased class; ii) in the ""high problem drinking/increased"" class, relative to the low problem drinking/decreased class, experience of domestic violence (OR = 1.857, p < .05), work-family balance stress (OR = 1.309, p < .05), and gender role perception (OR = .705, p < .05) were significant predictors of drinking behavior.Problem drinking in Korean women demonstrated heterogeneous patterns of change, with gender-specific factors being the main predictors of this change. Therefore, this study developed a strategy for reducing the harmful effects of female drinking, which considers the characteristics of the changes in women's drinking patterns as well as factors from the gender perspective.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13011-022-00481-3,
Latent Growth Mixture Modeling to Estimate Differential PTSD Trajectories and Associated Risk Factors in Psychiatric Staff Following Workplace Violence,"Background: Workplace violence (WV) towards psychiatric staff has commonly been associated with Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD). However, prospective studies have shown that not all psychiatric staff who experience workplace violence experience post-traumatic stress. Purpose: We want to examine the longitudinal trajectories of PTSD in this population to identify possible subgroups that might be more at risk. Furthermore, we need to investigate whether certain risk factors of PTSD might identify membership in the subgroups. Method: In a sample of psychiatric staff from 18 psychiatric wards in Denmark who had reported an incident of WV, we used Latent Growth Mixture Modelling (LGMM) and further logistic regression analysis to investigate this. Results: We found three separate PTSD trajectories: a recovering, a delayed-onset, and a moderate-stable trajectory. Higher social support and negative cognitive appraisals about oneself, the world and self-blame predicted membership in the delayed-onset trajectory, while higher social support and lower accept coping predicted membership in the delayed-onset trajectory. Conclusion: Although most psychiatric staff go through a natural recovery, it is important to be aware of and identify staff members who might be struggling long-term. More focus on the factors that might predict these groups should be an important task for psychiatric departments to prevent posttraumatic symptomatology from work.",https://doi.org/10.4236/ojepi.2023.134026,
The Longitudinal Role of Self-Concept Clarity and Best Friend Delinquency in Adolescent Delinquent Behavior,"Adolescence tends to be characterized by a temporary peak in delinquent behavior, and friends in particular play a key role in the initiation and the development of delinquency. However, adolescents differ in their susceptibility to friends' influence on delinquency. Especially adolescents who are less certain about who they are might show more delinquent behavior, and might be more susceptible to their friends' behaviors, as friends are also crucial for adolescents' identity formation. In addition to examining the main effects of best friend's delinquency and self-concept clarity on the development of adolescents' delinquency, the current study scrutinized whether self-concept clarity moderated the longitudinal association between adolescents' and their best friends' self-reported delinquent behavior. The current study examined whether best friend delinquency and adolescent self-concept clarity were related to the development of adolescents' delinquency, and whether self-concept clarity moderated the relation between adolescent and best friend delinquency. Dutch adolescents (N = 497, Mage Wave 1 = 13 years, 287 boys) and their best friends participated across six annual waves. Both adolescents and best friends reported on their delinquency and adolescents reported on their self-concept clarity. Adolescent delinquency linearly declined, and although adolescents' and best friends' delinquency levels were related, changes in delinquency of adolescents and best friends were not. Adolescents low on self-concept clarity reported higher levels of delinquency. Self-concept clarity also moderated the relation between adolescent and best friend delinquency levels, with stronger relations observed for adolescents with lower self-concept clarity. Future research should examine the protective role of self-concept clarity not only against delinquent behavior, but also against susceptibility to peer influence.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-019-00997-1,
"Trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms from infancy through early childhood: The roles of perceived financial strain, social support, and intimate partner violence","Abstract Although new mothers are at risk of heightened vulnerability for depressive symptoms, there is limited understanding regarding changes in maternal depressive symptoms over the course of the postpartum and early childhood of their child’s life among rural, low-income mothers from diverse racial backgrounds. This study examined distinct trajectories of depressive symptoms among rural low-income mothers during the first five years of their child’s life, at 6, 15, 24, and 58 months, using data from the Family Life Project ( N = 1,292). Latent class growth analysis identified four distinct trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms, including Low-decreasing (50%; n = 622), Low-increasing (26%; n = 324), Moderate-decreasing (13%; n = 156), and Moderate-increasing (11%; n = 131) trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression demonstrated that higher perceived financial strain and intimate partner violence, and lower social support predicted higher-risk trajectories ( Low-increasing , Moderate-decreasing , and Moderate-increasing) relative to the Low-decreasing trajectory. Compared to the Low-decreasing trajectory, lower neighborhood safety/quietness predicted to the Low-increasing trajectory. Moreover, lower social support predicted the Moderate-increasing trajectory, the highest-risk trajectory, compared to those in Moderate-decreasing . The current analyses underscore the heterogeneity on patterns of depressive symptoms among rural, low-income mothers, and that the role of both proximal and broader contexts contributing to distinct trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms over early childhood.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579424000117,
The better of two evils? Evidence that children exhibiting continuous conduct problems high or low on callous–unemotional traits score on opposite directions on physiological and behavioral measures of fear,"Abstract The present study examines whether heterogeneous groups of children identified based on their longitudinal scores on conduct problems (CP) and callous–unemotional (CU) traits differ on physiological and behavioral measures of fear. Specifically, it aims to test the hypothesis that children with high/stable CP differentiated on CU traits score on opposite directions on a fear–fearless continuum. Seventy-three participants ( M age = 11.21; 45.2% female) were selected from a sample of 1,200 children. Children and their parents completed a battery of questionnaires assessing fearfulness, sensitivity to punishment, and behavioral inhibition. Children also participated in an experiment assessing their startle reactivity to fearful mental imagery, a well-established index of defensive motivation. The pattern of results verifies the hypothesis that fearlessness, assessed with physiological and behavioral measures, is a core characteristic of children high on both CP and CU traits (i.e., receiving the DSM-5 specifier of limited prosocial emotions). To the contrary, children with high/stable CP and low CU traits demonstrated high responsiveness to fear, high behavioral inhibition, and high sensitivity to punishment. The study is in accord with the principle of equifinality, in that different developmental mechanisms (i.e., extremes of high and low fear) may have the same behavioral outcome manifested as phenotypic antisocial behavior.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579415000371,

Adolescent sexual aggressiveness and pornography use: A longitudinal assessment,"Abstract The rising prevalence of (online) pornography use among, mostly male, adolescents revived social concerns regarding possible effects of pornography use on sexual aggressiveness. Given the paucity of longitudinal explorations of this link, this study focused on the following two research questions: (Q1) Is pornography use during middle to late adolescence related to male adolescents’ self‐reported sexual aggressiveness; and (Q2) can personality traits and characteristics that have been associated with sexual aggression account for this presumed link? Using data from a six‐wave panel sample of 594 male Croatian high‐school sophomore students ( M age at baseline = 15.8 years, SD = 0.52), latent class and latent growth curve modeling were employed to answer these questions. There was a significant baseline difference in the frequency of pornography use between participants who reported no or marginal levels of sexual aggressiveness during the period under observation (20 months) and their peers who reported substantial sexual aggressiveness, with the former reporting significantly lower initial levels of pornography use compared to the latter. Controlling for personality characteristics did not cancel this association. In addition, bullying and reported peer pressure significantly predicted initial levels of pornography use, but not its subsequent change. With the controls omitted from the analysis, a slight average increase in pornography use was observed among adolescents who reported no or lowest levels of sexual aggressiveness. In contrast, pornography use decreased somewhat among their peers who reported moderate sexual aggressiveness. Insights from this study can contribute to school‐based sexual violence prevention programs, as well as inform recently proposed pornography literacy programs which aim to assist adolescents in navigating the increasingly sexually explicit online environment.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ab.21854,
Self-control forecasts better psychosocial outcomes but faster epigenetic aging in low-SES youth,"Significance Most childhood outcomes pattern by socioeconomic status (SES). Children from low-SES families complete less education, have worse health, and are convicted of more crimes. To ameliorate these disparities, policymakers are incorporating character-skills training into school curricula and social services. Among other goals, these programs attempt to improve self-control, or the ability to resist temptations that interfere with long-term aspirations. However, data suggest that self-control has unforeseen consequences for the health of low-SES youth. Here, we follow 292 African American teenagers as they transition into adulthood. Among low-SES youth, self-control forecasted better psychosocial outcomes, including less depression, substance use, and aggression. However, it also forecasted more rapid immune cell aging, highlighting the potential health costs of successful adjustment for disadvantaged youth.",https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1505063112,
The Impact of Family Separation and Worry About Family on Psychological Adjustment in Refugees Resettled in Australia,"Abstract Few reliable predictors of postarrival psychological adjustment have been identified with regard to refugees once they arrive in their host country. We investigated the association between family separation and psychological symptoms in refugees resettled in Australia from 2013 to 2016. Participants were 1,495 adult refugees ( M = 38.9 years, SD = 12.7) who participated in the Building a New Life in Australia population‐based study across 4 years. Participants were assessed for psychological distress and posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) using the Kessler Psychological Distress Scale (K6) and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder–8 (PTSD‐8), respectively. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify latent longitudinal trajectories and binary logistic regression to assess the contribution of family predictor variables toward PTSD‐8 and K6 symptom trajectory class membership. The LCGA supported a four‐class solution for PTSS, categorized as improving PTSS (18.4%), persistently high PTSS (11.5%), resilient PTSS (57.3%), and deteriorating PTSS (12.6%). For the K6, LCGA supported a four‐class solution comprising classes categorized as persistently high psychological distress (PD; 7.0%), improving PD (17.3%), resilient PD (61.1%), and deteriorating PD (14.6%). Separation from family members did not independently predict the course of psychological symptoms; however, worry about family and friends contributed to the persistence of high PTSD‐8 scores, OR = 1.75, and deteriorating K6 scores, OR = 1.57. The current findings suggest persistently high or worsening psychological symptom trajectories during the postsettlement phase may be marked by worry about family and friends, in addition to older age and female gender, rather than separation alone.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22568,
Chronic anger as a precursor to adult antisocial personality features: The moderating influence of cognitive control.,"Anger is among the earliest occurring symptoms of mental health, yet we know little about its developmental course. Further, no studies have examined whether youth with persistent anger are at an increased risk of exhibiting antisocial personality features in adulthood, or how cognitive control abilities may protect these individuals from developing such maladaptive outcomes. Trajectories of anger were delineated among 503 boys using annual assessments from childhood to middle adolescence (ages ∼7-14). Associations between these trajectories and features of antisocial personality in young adulthood (age ∼28) were examined, including whether cognitive control moderates this association. Five trajectories of anger were identified (i.e., childhood-onset, childhood-limited, adolescent-onset, moderate, and low). Boys in the childhood-onset group exhibited the highest adulthood antisocial personality features (e.g., psychopathy, aggression, criminal charges). However, boys in this group were buffered from these problems if they had higher levels of cognitive control during adolescence. Findings were consistent across measures from multiple informants, replicated across distinct time periods, and remained when controlling for general intelligence and prior antisocial behavior. This is the first study to document the considerable heterogeneity in the developmental course of anger from childhood to adolescence.

Interpersonal Callousness from Childhood to Adolescence: Developmental Trajectories and Early Risk Factors,"Youth with a callous interpersonal style, consistent with features of adult psychopathy (e.g., lack of guilt, deceitful), are at risk for exhibiting severe and protracted antisocial behaviors. However, no studies have examined changes that occur in interpersonal callousness (IC) from childhood to adolescence, and little is known about the influence of early child, social, and contextual factors on trajectories of IC. The current study examined distinct patterns of IC across childhood and adolescence and associations with early risk factors. Participants were an at-risk sample of 503 boys (56% African American) assessed annually from around ages 7–15. Analyses examined child (anger dysregulation, fearfulness), social (peer, family, maltreatment), and contextual (psychosocial adversity) factors associated with teacher-reported IC trajectories across childhood and adolescence. Using latent class growth analysis, five trajectories of IC were identified (early-onset chronic, childhood-limited, adolescent-onset, moderate, low). Approximately 10% of boys followed an early-onset chronic trajectory, and a roughly equal percent of youth followed childhood-limited trajectory (10%) or an adolescent-onset trajectory (12%) of IC across development. Specifically, half of the boys with high IC in childhood did not continue to exhibit significant levels of these features into adolescence, whereas an equal proportion of youth with low IC in childhood demonstrated increasing levels during the transition to adolescence. Boys in the early-onset chronic group were characterized by the most risk factors and were differentiated from those with childhood-limited and adolescent-onset IC only by higher conduct problems, fearlessness, and emotional abuse/neglect. Findings are discussed in terms of developmental models of IC and several avenues for early targeted interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2016.1144190,
Stability and change in callous-unemotional traits: Longitudinal associations with potential individual and contextual risk and protective factors.,"This longitudinal study examines developmental heterogeneity in callous-unemotional (CU) traits in a large sample of school-age children in Cyprus. Latent Class Growth Analysis revealed 4 trajectory groups of CU traits across 3 time points: stable high, increasing, decreasing, and low. Findings suggested that children in the stable high CU trajectory were more likely to (a) exhibit high and stable levels of conduct problems, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder symptoms, impulsivity and narcissism, (b) experience low parental involvement and high parental distress, (c) report low peer support and school connectedness, and (d) score lower on academic performance, executive functioning, social competence, and self-regulation compared to children with low, decreasing, and increasing CU traits. These findings were verified by both parent and child reports. Repeated analysis of variance suggested that increases and decreases in CU traits were associated with similar changes in conduct problems, narcissism, impulsivity, and maternal involvement. Further, children in the decreasing trajectory group were not differentiated from children in the low risk group on measures of executive functioning, academic performance, school connectedness, and peer social support at the last wave of measurement. These findings provide evidence for the importance of taking longitudinal change into account for understanding developmental heterogeneity in CU traits and the association of these traits with possible protective (e.g., stable high maternal involvement) and risk (e.g., decreases in maternal involvement and increases in conduct problems, impulsivity and narcissism) variables.

Heterogeneity in Response during Multisystemic Therapy: Exploring Subgroups and Predictors,"Multiple studies have shown that Multisystemic Therapy (MST) is, at group level, an effective treatment for adolescents showing serious externalizing problem behavior. The current study expands previous research on MST by, first, examining whether subgroups of participants who respond differently to treatment could be identified. Second, we investigated if the different trajectories of change during MST could be predicted by individual (hostile attributions) and contextual (parental sense of parenting competence and deviant and prosocial peer involvement) pre-treatment factors. Participants were 147 adolescents (mean age = 15.91 years, 104 (71%) boys) and their parents who received MST. Pre-treatment assessment of the predictors and 5 monthly assessments of externalizing behavior during treatment took place using both adolescent and parents' self-reports. Six distinct subgroups, showing different trajectories of change in externalizing problem behavior during MST, were identified. Two of the 6 trajectories of change showed a poor treatment response, as one class did not change in externalizing problem behavior and the other class even increased. The remaining 4 trajectories displayed a positive effect of MST, by showing a decrease in externalizing behavior. Most of these trajectories could be predicted by parental sense of parenting competence. Additionally, lower involvement with prosocial peers was a predictor of the group that appeared to be resistant to MST. Adolescents do respond differently to MST, which indicates the importance of personalizing treatment. Protective factors, such as parental sense of parenting competence and prosocial peers, seem to require additional attention in the first phase of MST.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-016-0242-9,
A Systematic Review of Latent Variable Mixture Modeling Research in Social Work Journals,"Purpose: Latent variable mixture modeling (LVMM) estimates possible classes, profiles, or trajectories within a sample and then identifies individuals with similar patterns. This systematic review examines the use of person-centered LVMM analyses published in social work journals.Methods: We screened 478 articles and obtained a final sample of 32 studies meeting inclusion criteria.Results: Studies using LVMM were published between 2004 and 2017 with a majority appearing after 2012. Latent class analysis was used in most studies followed by latent profile analysis and longitudinal variants of LVMM. Samples sizes ranged from 199 to 1,002,122 (median = 533). Less than half of the identified studies met model fit reporting standards.Discussion: This systematic review demonstrates the usefulness and growing popularity of LVMM studies within social work journals.

Identifying early pathways of risk and resilience: The codevelopment of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and the role of harsh parenting,"Abstract Psychological disorders co-occur often in children, but little has been done to document the types of conjoint pathways internalizing and externalizing symptoms may take from the crucial early period of toddlerhood or how harsh parenting may overlap with early symptom codevelopment. To examine symptom codevelopment trajectories, we identified latent classes of individuals based on internalizing and externalizing symptoms across ages 3–9 and found three symptom codevelopment classes: normative symptoms (low), severe-decreasing symptoms (initially high but rapidly declining), and severe symptoms (high) trajectories. Next, joint models examined how parenting trajectories overlapped with internalizing and externalizing symptom trajectories. These trajectory classes demonstrated that, normatively, harsh parenting increased after toddlerhood, but the severe symptoms class was characterized by a higher level and a steeper increase in harsh parenting and the severe-decreasing class by high, stable harsh parenting. In addition, a transactional model examined the bidirectional relationships among internalizing and externalizing symptoms and harsh parenting because they may cascade over time in this early period. Harsh parenting uniquely contributed to externalizing symptoms, controlling for internalizing symptoms, but not vice versa. In addition, internalizing symptoms appeared to be a mechanism by which externalizing symptoms increase. Results highlight the importance of accounting for both internalizing and externalizing symptoms from an early age to understand risk for developing psychopathology and the role harsh parenting plays in influencing these trajectories.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579414001412,
Aggressive delinquency among north American indigenous adolescents: Trajectories and predictors,"Aggressive delinquency is a salient social problem for many North American Indigenous (American Indian, Canadian First Nations) communities, and can have deleterious consequences later in life. Yet there is a paucity of research on Indigenous delinquency. Group‐based trajectory modeling is used to prospectively examine trajectories of aggressive delinquency over the course of adolescence using data from 646 Indigenous adolescents from a single culture, spanning the ages of 10–19. Five aggression trajectory groups were identified, characterized by different levels and ages of onset and desistence: non‐offenders (22.1%), moderate desistors (19.9%), adolescent‐limited offenders (22.2%), high desistors (16.7%), and chronic offenders (19.2%). Using the social development model of antisocial behavior, we selected relevant risk and protective factors predicted to discriminate among those most and least likely to engage in more aggressive behavior. Higher levels of risk (i.e., parent rejection, delinquent peers, substance use, and early dating) in early adolescence were associated with being in the two groups with the highest levels of aggressive delinquency. Positive school adjustment, the only significant protective factor, was associated with being in the lowest aggression trajectory groups. The results provide important information that could be used in developing prevention and intervention programs, particularly regarding vulnerable ages as well as malleable risk factors. Identifying those youth most at risk of engaging in higher levels of aggression may be key to preventing delinquency and reducing the over‐representation of Indigenous youth in the justice system.

Developmental Trajectories of Physical Aggression and Nonaggressive Rule-Breaking During Late Childhood and Early Adolescence,"Research has consistently linked two forms of childhood antisocial behavior, physical aggression and nonaggressive rule-breaking, to adolescent delinquency. However, there is a lack of knowledge regarding the development of problem behavior during the latter years of childhood and early adolescence (ages 6 to 14). The current study utilized longitudinal data that followed 756 at-risk males and females from early childhood into early adolescence to identify trajectories of physical aggression and nonaggressive rule-breaking and the association between documented risk factors with class membership. The findings supported a four-class model for both physical aggression and nonaggressive rule-breaking. Both models produced high, moderately high, average, and abstaining classes. However, the physical aggression models decreased as participants aged, while the nonaggressive rule-breaking classes increased. Family adversity, protective neighborhoods, negative child temperament, premature birth, race, and gender were associated with class membership. The study findings may inform targeted, problem-specific strategies aimed at early intervention.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0093854818803652,
&lt;p&gt;Trajectory Modelling Techniques Useful to Epidemiological Research: A Comparative Narrative Review of Approaches&lt;/p&gt;,"Abstract: Trajectory modelling techniques have been developed to determine subgroups within a given population and are increasingly used to better understand intra- and inter-individual variability in health outcome patterns over time. The objectives of this narrative review are to explore various trajectory modelling approaches useful to epidemiological research and give an overview of their applications and differences. Guidance for reporting on the results of trajectory modelling is also covered. Trajectory modelling techniques reviewed include latent class modelling approaches, ie, growth mixture modelling (GMM), group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM), latent class analysis (LCA), and latent transition analysis (LTA). A parallel is drawn to other individual-centered statistical approaches such as cluster analysis (CA) and sequence analysis (SA). Depending on the research question and type of data, a number of approaches can be used for trajectory modelling of health outcomes measured in longitudinal studies. However, the various terms to designate latent class modelling approaches (GMM, GBTM, LTA, LCA) are used inconsistently and often interchangeably in the available scientific literature. Improved consistency in the terminology and reporting guidelines have the potential to increase researchers' efficiency when it comes to choosing the most appropriate technique that best suits their research questions.

Trajectories of prolonged grief one to six years after a natural disaster,"Background The long-term trajectories of prolonged grief are poorly understood. The aims were to examine the course of grief among bereaved disaster survivors up to six years post loss and factors predicting worse bereavement outcome. A third aim was to explore differences in grief indicators between trajectories. Methods Bereaved Swedish tourists who survived the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunamis responded to surveys including the Inventory of Complicated Grief 1 to 6 years after the disaster. Latent growth mixture modeling was used to identify longitudinal trajectories of grief. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to examine predictors of class membership. Results Three trajectories were identified: resilient (41% of the sample), recovering (48%), and chronic (11%). The strongest predictor of chronic grief was the loss of one's child. When examining grief indicators, the chronic trajectory was characterized by not accepting the loss, while yearning was common in all trajectories. Conclusions This study highlights the importance of considering how traumatically bereaved individuals can be affected by loss for several years after a disaster, especially after losing one's child. An inability to accept the loss, more so than yearning, appears to characterize bereaved survivors at risk of a chronic trajectory of grief.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0209757,
"Early Crying, Sleeping, and Feeding Problems and Trajectories of Attention Problems From Childhood to Adulthood","This study investigated if crying, sleeping or feeding problems that co‐occur (multiple regulatory problems [RPs]) or are persistent predict attention problems and diagnoses of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in childhood and adulthood. Participants were 342 individuals who were assessed at 5, 20, and 56 months for crying, sleeping, and feeding (RPs) and at 6, 8, and 28 years for ADHD diagnoses, attention problems, and attention span. Infants/toddlers with multiple/persistent RPs had an increased risk of receiving an ADHD diagnosis both in childhood and adulthood compared to those who never had RPs. Multiple/persistent RPs were further associated with a high‐decreasing attention problems trajectory from childhood to adulthood. Interventions to alleviate early RPs may prevent the development of attention problems.",https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13155,

A total of 968 Japanese adolescents including 13‐ and 16‐years‐olds (49.7% female) participated in a four‐wave longitudinal study. Latent class growth analysis extracted five identity trajectories in each educational and interpersonal identity domain and revealed (a) high prevalence of low commitment identity trajectories, (b) absence of the closure trajectory, and (c) changeable identity trajectories that have not been identified in Western context (i.e., the Netherlands). Furthermore, a latent change model revealed dynamic relations between identity trajectories and psychosocial functioning.

Increased Skin Conductance Response in the Immediate Aftermath of Trauma Predicts PTSD Risk,"Background Exposure to a traumatic event leads to posttraumatic stress disorder in 10% to 20% of exposed individuals. Predictors of risk are needed to target early interventions to those who are most vulnerable. The objective of the study was to test whether a noninvasive mobile device that measures a physiological biomarker of autonomic nervous system activation could predict future posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms. Methods Skin conductance response was collected during a trauma interview in the emergency department within hours of exposure to trauma in 95 individuals. Trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder symptoms over 12-month posttrauma were identified using latent growth mixture modeling. Results Skin conductance response was significantly correlated with the probability of being in the chronic posttraumatic stress disorder trajectory following trauma exposure in the emergency department (r = 0.489, p &lt; 0.000001). Lasso regression with elastic net was performed with demographic and clinical measures obtained in the emergency department, demonstrating that skin conductance response was the most significant predictor of the chronic posttraumatic stress disorder trajectory (p &lt; 0.00001). Conclusions This study is the first prospective study of posttraumatic stress disorder showing skin conductance response in the immediate aftermath of trauma predicts subsequent development of chronic posttraumatic stress disorder. This finding points to an easily obtained, and neurobiologically informative, biomarker in emergency departments that can be disseminated to predict the development of posttraumatic stress disorder.",https://doi.org/10.1177/2470547019844441,
"Associations between infant and toddler regulatory problems, childhood co‐developing internalising and externalising trajectories, and adolescent depression, psychotic and borderline personality disorder symptoms","Background Early regulatory problems (RPs) are associated with childhood internalising and externalising symptoms. Internalising and externalising symptoms, in turn, are associated with adolescent psychopathology (e.g. personality disorders, depression). We examined whether RPs are directly associated with adolescent psychopathology, or whether associations are indirect via childhood internalising and externalising symptoms. Methods We used data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children. Mothers reported on their child's RPs at 6, 15–18 and 24–30 months, and internalising and externalising symptoms at 4, 7, 8 and 9.5 years. Adolescent psychotic, depression and BPD symptoms were assessed at 11–12 years. Children were grouped by their patterns of co‐developing internalising and externalising symptoms using parallel process latent class growth analysis (PP‐LCGA). Path analysis was used to examine direct and indirect associations from RPs to the three adolescent outcomes. Results There were four groups of children with distinct patterns of co‐developing internalising and externalising (INT/EXT) symptoms. Most children (53%) demonstrated low–moderate and stable levels of INT/EXT symptoms. A small proportion (7.7%) evidenced moderate and increasing INT and high stable EXT symptoms: this pattern was strongly predictive of adolescent psychopathology (e.g. depression at 11 years: unadjusted odds ratio = 5.62; 95% confidence intervals = 3.82, 8.27). The other two groups were differentially associated with adolescent outcomes (i.e. moderate–high increasing INT/moderate decreasing EXT predicted mother‐reported depression at 12, while low stable INT/moderate–high stable EXT predicted child‐reported depression at 11). In path analysis, RPs at each time‐point were significantly indirectly associated with symptoms of BPD and child‐ and mother‐reported depression symptoms via the most severe class of INT/EXT symptoms. Conclusions Consistent with a cascade model of development, RPs are predictive of higher levels of co‐developing INT/EXT symptoms, which in turn increase risk of adolescent psychopathology. Clinicians should be aware of, and treat, early RPs to prevent chronic psychopathology.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13125,
Suicide Ideation and Social Support Trajectories in National Guard and Reserve Servicemembers,"AbstractObjective: Since 2004 increased rates of suicide have been noted in the US Armed Forces. We examined the association of social support (SS) trajectories and suicide ideation (SI) over a four-year period in Reserve Component (RC) servicemembers (National Guard and Reserve). We also examined baseline mental health measures, as predictors of the identified trajectories. Methods: Structured interviews were conducted with a nationally representative sample of 1,582 RC servicemembers at baseline and three follow-up waves. Latent growth mixture modeling identified SS trajectories and the association with follow-up SI. Multinomial logistic regression analyses were used to predict SS trajectories using baseline measures of demographics and mental health. Results: We identified four trajectories of SS and their associated prevalence of follow-up SI: low (n = 60, 3.8%; SI = 30.5%), medium (n = 229, 14.5%; SI = 14.1%), high–low (n = 66, 4.2%; SI = 13.6%), and high–high (n = 1,227, 77.5%; SI = 4.2%). There were significant differences in follow-up SI prevalence between each pair of SS trajectories except between the medium-SS and high-low-SS trajectories. Baseline SI, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, binge drinking, and mental health diagnosis were associated with increased likelihood of being on a low-SS or medium-SS trajectory. Baseline PTSD discriminated being on the high-high-SS and high-low-SS trajectories. Conclusion: Results support four trajectories of social support and that individuals with low or decreasing SS are likely to have greater follow-up SI. Baseline mental health assessments can identify these risk trajectories.

Positive Affect Over Time and Emotion Regulation Strategies: Exploring Trajectories With Latent Growth Mixture Model Analysis,"The influence of Positive Affect (PA) on people's well-being and happiness and the related positive consequences on everyday life have been extensively described by positive psychology in the past decades. This study shows an application of Latent Growth Mixture Modeling (LGMM) to explore the existence of different trajectories of variation of PA over time, corresponding to different groups of people, and to observe the effect of emotion regulation strategies on these trajectories. We involved 108 undergraduates in a one-week daily on-line survey, assessing their PA. We also measured their emotion regulation strategies before the survey. We identified three trajectories of PA over time: a constantly high PA profile, an increasing PA profile, and a decreasing PA profile. Considering emotion regulation strategies as covariates, reappraisal showed an effect on trajectories, and on class membership, whereas suppression regulation strategy did not.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01575,
Trajectories of adolescent conduct problems in relation to cortical thickness development: a longitudinal MRI study,"Abstract Multiple cross-sectional imaging studies have identified structural abnormalities in prefrontal, temporal and limbic regions related to conduct problems (CPs). However, the relationship between development of such neurobiological deficits and developmental pathways of CPs has remained unclear. The current study investigated distinct trajectories of CP and related trajectories of cortical thickness within a community-based sample of adolescents ( n =239), age range 12–19, to address this gap. Three trajectory classes were revealed using latent class growth analyses (LCGAs), comprising a ‘desisting’ CP group, an ‘intermediate’ CP group and a ‘stable low’ CP group. Structural magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans were collected with a subgroup of 171 adolescents at three waves throughout adolescence (ages 12, 16 and 19). Generalized estimating equation (GEE) analysis—comparing longitudinal changes in cortical thickness and subcortical volume between CP groups for several regions of interest (ROIs)—showed that these CP groups had differential trajectories of cortical thickness in the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (dl-PFC), and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), and volume of the hippocampus. Adolescents in the desisting CP group showed an attenuation of the typical pattern of cortical thinning as present in the intermediate and stable low CP groups, in addition to an exaggeration of the typical pattern of hippocampal volume increase. These findings suggest that a deviant cortical thickness trajectory was related to a desisting CP pathway across adolescence. Such deviant neurodevelopmental growth trajectories may act as an underlying mechanism for developmental CP pathways, and possibly distinguish desisting antisocial adolescents.",https://doi.org/10.1038/tp.2016.111,
Long-Term Trajectories of Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Categorical versus Continuous Assessment,"Objective: Long-term trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) may fluctuate over time and typically conform to four heterogeneous patterns: resilience, recovery, delayed-onset, and chronic symptomatology. However, such fluctuations are typically short ranged and have rarely been investigated over the course of decades after the trauma. Moreover, existing studies have used a variety of measurements, either employing a categorical Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM)-oriented approach or a continuous measure of symptom severity. The aim of this study was to evaluate the two methods of analyzing trajectories of PTSD by examining the level of concordance between them, their sensitivity, and their validity. Method: A total of 349 Israeli veterans from the 1973 Yom Kippur War were examined at four time points over more than four decades since the war. A latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was conducted to identify different PTSD trajectories, using both categorical and continuous PTSD assessments. Results: Descriptive results revealed that the four commonly observed patterns of PTSD are insufficient for capturing the range of individual PTSD trajectories. Using a categorical measure in the explorative LCGA yielded three trajectories (resilient, chronic, and delayed onset). The continuous measure yielded five trajectories (resilient, chronic, recovered, and two delayed-onset trajectories), which provided a slightly more nuanced distinction of participants' distress-induced psychosocial dysfunction as compared to the three-trajectory solution. Conclusion: These findings suggest that using a continuous PTSD trajectory measure provides a somewhat more sensitive estimation of PTSD trajectories. More specifically, taking into consideration symptom intensity and fluctuation over time may provide a more comprehensive picture of the survivors' distress.",https://doi.org/10.1080/00332747.2018.1485369,
Identity Formation in Adolescence: The Dynamic of Forming and Consolidating Identity Commitments,"Abstract The biological, cognitive, and social changes that occur in adolescence stimulate young people to think about themselves, reflect on the kind of people they want to become, and find their place in society. Traditionally, these changes have been explained by Erikson's theory and Marcia's identity status model, but process‐oriented models of identity provide new insights. In particular, dual‐cycle models, such as the three‐factor identity model, focus on the dynamic process by which young people iteratively form and maintain their identity over time. This iterative process is captured by the interplay of commitment, in‐depth exploration, and reconsideration of commitment, as well as by distinct identity statuses. Furthermore, the extent to which adolescents find a stable identity is intertwined strongly with their psychosocial functioning and well‐being.",https://doi.org/10.1111/cdep.12226,
Neighborhood predictors of bullying perpetration and victimization trajectories among South Korean adolescents,"This study examined latent trajectories of bullying perpetration and victimization, and identified neighborhood antecedents of these trajectories among South Korean adolescents.Nationally representative individual-level data from waves 2 to 6 (middle school to high school) of the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey were merged with neighborhood-level data drawn from the Korean Census and the Korean Ministry of Education. Latent class growth analysis (N = 2,178) and logistic regression were conducted (N = 2,021).Three unique trajectories of bullying experience-low-risk (80.8%), transient (13.3%), high-risk (5.9%)-were identified. Neighborhood factors (e.g., public assistance receipt, marital status, official bullying incidents, collective efficacy) predicted these distinct developmental paths.Joint trajectories of perpetration and victimization can inform service or policy decisions as each developmental path may represent unique experiences for youth in need of specific resources for treatment or intervention. Neighborhood indicators are important predictors of developmental trajectories of bullying experience among adolescents.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jcop.22226,
"Smartphone Addiction, Social Support, and Cybercrime Victimization: A Discrete Survival and Growth Mixture Model","In recent decades, criminological theories have identified a set of vulnerabilities in potential victims that seek to explain their victimization. When it comes to explaining cybercrime victimization, however, the important role that addiction to the vulnerabilities associated with technological devices can play has tended to be overlooked. In this paper we empirically link smartphone addiction, social support, and cyberfraud victimization in a nationally representative sample of 716 smartphone users followed for three years. The results of discrete survival and growth mixture models suggest that the probability of cyberfraud victimization is lower among users with a decrease in smartphone addiction and an increase in social support over the three years. These results allow us to suggest new avenues in the study of cybercrime victimization, with special emphasis on the psychosocial consequences that the deregulated use of these technological devices may entail.En las últimas décadas, las teorías criminológicas han identificado una serie de vulnerabilidades en las víctimas potenciales que tratan de explicar su victimización. Sin embargo, cuando se trata de explicar la victimización por ciberdelincuencia, se ha tendido a pasar por alto el importante papel que puede desempeñar la adicción a los dispositivos tecnológicos y sus consecuencias psicosociales. En este trabajo relacionamos empíricamente la adicción a los smartphones, el apoyo social y la victimización por ciberdelincuencia en una muestra representativa a nivel nacional de 716 usuarios a los que se siguió durante tres años. Los resultados de los modelos de curvas de supervivencia para tiempo discreto y mixtura de crecimiento latente sugieren que la probabilidad de victimización por ciberfraude es menor entre los usuarios con una disminución de la adicción a los teléfonos inteligentes y un aumento del apoyo social a lo largo de los tres años. Estos resultados nos permiten sugerir nuevas vías en el estudio de la victimización por ciberdelincuencia, con especial énfasis en las consecuencias psicosociales que puede conllevar el uso desregulado de estos dispositivos tecnológicos.",https://doi.org/10.5093/pi2022a3,
Melding theoretical perspectives: a gendered look at low-resting heart rate and developmental trajectories of antisocial behavior,"The biosocial theoretical perspective is a growing area within criminological theory; however, skepticism remains toward such new research endeavors. Uncertainty may come from a perceived lack of connection to existing theories of criminality and/or the apparent resources required in conducting biosocial research. Therefore, the aim of this study was twofold. First, by utilizing the public version of National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent Health (Add Health) data, this study provides an example of biosocial research that does not require the use of expensive laboratory equipment or restrictive datasets. Second, by utilizing a sample of 1629 individuals followed from age 13 to 29, a longitudinal latent class analysis was estimated to explore the relationship between low-resting heart rate and antisocial behavior for both males and females. Doing so, the current study integrates a well-researched correlate of biosocial criminology with mainstream criminological theories (i.e. developmental theories), while also employing a fairly novel approach to group-based trajectory modeling.",https://doi.org/10.1080/1478601x.2015.1004915,

Trajectories of alcohol use and association with symptoms of depression from early to late adolescence: The <scp>N</scp>orwegian <scp>L</scp>ongitudinal <scp>H</scp>ealth <scp>B</scp>ehaviour <scp>S</scp>tudy,"Adolescence is a period in which many have an onset of alcohol use, but there is much heterogeneity in the individual development of alcohol use. Further, there is a general increase in depressive symptoms from early to late adolescence, but less is known about how different alcohol habit trajectories are associated with symptoms of depression. The aims of the present study were: to identify trajectories of alcohol consumption and drinking to intoxication during adolescence (age 13-18 years); and examine to what extent the different trajectories of alcohol use were associated with symptoms of depression over the same age span, from early to late adolescence.Data from the Norwegian Longitudinal Health Behaviour Study were employed. Latent class growth analyses were employed to identify different trajectories of both alcohol consumption and drinking to intoxication. The resulting trajectories for each participant were used to estimate the gender-adjusted association between different development of alcohol use and symptoms of depression.Four trajectories of both alcohol consumption and drinking to intoxication were identified. The trajectories with an early onset of alcohol consumption or drinking to intoxication were associated with higher levels of depressive symptoms compared with late onset or stable low use trajectories.The findings from the present study suggest that early onset developmental trajectories of alcohol use are associated with depression. Therefore, broad assessment and interventions targeting both alcohol and depression may be indicated among early onset alcohol users, especially if they report increasing levels of consumption.

The role of family and peer factors in the development of early adolescent depressive symptoms: A latent class growth analysis,"Few studies have explored the trajectories of Chinese early adolescent depressive symptoms or comprehensively considered the factors of family and peers. The present study aimed to identify the trajectories of depressive symptoms in early adolescence using a school-based sample assessed in three waves. The study also examined whether family and peer factors were significant predictors. A total of 586 Chinese primary and middle school students participated in the survey. A growth mixture model was used to find the trajectories of depressive symptoms, and multinominal logistic regression was used to identify the predictors. Three trajectories were identified, including a stable-low class, an increasing class, and a high-decreasing class. Results indicated that gender, parental psychological aggression and neglect, parental psychological control, traditional bullying/cyberbullying victimization, and friendship quality were significant predictors. However, witnessing intimate partner violence, parental behavior control, and traditional bullying/cyberbullying perpetration could not significantly predict the trajectories. The findings of this study can provide an empirical basis for teachers and clinical interveners to determine different development trajectories of depressive symptoms and carry out prevention and intervention.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2022.914055,
Marital Conflict Trajectories and Associations With Children's Disruptive Behavior,"Abstract We seek to identify heterogeneous trajectories of marital conflict during the early childhood period, identify predictors associated with these trajectories, and examine associations between trajectory group membership and children's disruptive behavior. Participants were 469 families examined 4 times when the children were 2 to 54 months of age. Maternal reports of marital conflict, adverse childhood experiences, depressive symptoms, and sociodemographic characteristics were collected, and averaged maternal and paternal reports of child disruptive problems were used. Using growth mixture modeling, 3 trajectories of marital conflict were identified: high increasing (21.8%), high decreasing (7%), and low stable (71.2%). Maternal adverse childhood experiences predicted increased risk of belonging in the high‐increasing group, whereas depressive symptoms predicted increased risk of belonging in the high‐decreasing group. Importantly, children of mothers in the high‐increasing group exhibited higher levels of disruptive behavior at 54 months when compared with children of mothers in the high‐decreasing and low‐stable groups.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jomf.12356,

Post‐traumatic stress disorder: a state‐of‐the‐art review of evidence and challenges,"Post‐traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) is arguably the most common psychiatric disorder to arise after exposure to a traumatic event. Since its formal introduction in the DSM‐III in 1980, knowledge has grown significantly regarding its causes, maintaining mechanisms and treatments. Despite this increased understanding, however, the actual definition of the disorder remains controversial. The DSM‐5 and ICD‐11 define the disorder differently, reflecting disagreements in the field about whether the construct of PTSD should encompass a broad array of psychological manifestations that arise after trauma or should be focused more specifically on trauma memory phenomena. This controversy over clarifying the phenotype of PTSD has limited the capacity to identify biomarkers and specific mechanisms of traumatic stress. This review provides an up‐to‐date outline of the current definitions of PTSD, its known prevalence and risk factors, the main models to explain the disorder, and evidence‐supported treatments. A major conclusion is that, although trauma‐focused cognitive behavior therapy is the best‐validated treatment for PTSD, it has stagnated over recent decades, and only two‐thirds of PTSD patients respond adequately to this intervention. Moreover, most people with PTSD do not access evidence‐based treatment, and this situation is much worse in low‐ and middle‐income countries. Identifying processes that can overcome these major barriers to better management of people with PTSD remains an outstanding challenge.",https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20656,
Perinatal depressive symptoms among low-income South African women at risk of depression: trajectories and predictors,"The aim of the study was to identify trajectories of perinatal depressive symptoms and their predictors among women living in a low-resource setting in South Africa, and who present with a risk of depression during pregnancy.This is a secondary analysis of a randomised controlled trial among 384 women living in Khayelitsha, a low income setting in South Africa, recruited at their first antenatal visit if they scored 13 or above on the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale, were at least 18 years of age, less than 29 weeks pregnant and spoke isiXhosa. Participants were followed up at 8 months gestation, 3 and 12 months postpartum. Latent trajectories of depressive symptoms were identified using growth mixture modelling, based on the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale (HDRS). There were no differences in HDRS scores between the control and intervention arms, so all participants were assessed together. Health, social and economic predictors of trajectories were investigated to identify high-risk groups with greater or more chronic depressive symptoms, using univariate logistic regression.Two trajectories were identified: antenatal only (91.4%), with moderate to severe symptoms at baseline which later subside; and antenatal and postnatal (8.6%), with severe depressive symptoms during pregnancy and later in the postpartum period, which subside temporarily to moderate levels at 3 months postpartum. Predictors for the antenatal and postnatal trajectory include severe food insecurity, intimate partner violence, lower social support, greater functional impairment, problematic drinking and suicide risk.A small proportion of women who are at risk for depression antenatally remain at risk throughout the perinatal period, and can be differentiated from those who show a natural remission. Identification and referral strategies should be developed with these findings in mind, especially given the limited mental health resources in low-income settings.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-019-2355-y,
Mixture Modeling for Lifespan Developmental Research,"As part of the Generalized Structural Equation Modeling framework, mixture models are person-centered analyses seeking to identify distinct subpopulations, or profiles, of participants differing quantitatively and qualitatively from one another on a configuration of indicators and/or relations among these indicators. Mixture models are typological (resulting in a classification system), probabilistic (each participant having a probability of membership into all profiles based on prototypical similarity), and exploratory (the optimal model is typically selected based on a comparison of alternative specifications) in nature, and can take different forms. Latent profile analyses seek to identify subpopulations of participants differing from one another on a configuration of indicators and can be extended to factor mixture analyses allowing for the incorporation of latent factors to the model. In contrast, mixture regression analyses seek to identify subpopulations of participants’ differing from one another in terms of relations among profile indicators. These analyses can be extended to the multiple-group and/or longitudinal analyses, allowing researchers to conduct tests of profile similarity across different samples of participants or time points, and latent transition analyses can be used to assess probabilities of profiles transition over time among a sample of participants (i.e., within person stability and change in profile membership). Finally, growth mixture analyses are built from latent curve models and seek to identify subpopulations of participants following quantitatively and qualitatively distinct trajectories over time. All of these models can accommodate covariates, used either as predictors, correlates, or outcomes, and can even be extended to tests of mediation and moderation.",https://doi.org/10.1093/acrefore/9780190236557.013.364,
Efficacy of Bystander Programs to Prevent Dating Abuse Among Youth and Young Adults,"Estimates suggest that between 10% and 25% of adolescents have experienced some form of physical violence within a dating relationship, and one in four college-age women experiences attempted or completed sexual violence on campus. Bystander programs focus on equipping young adults with the skills to safely intervene when they witness behaviors that can result in dating abuse. This approach is promoted for its capacity both to transform community norms that contribute to dating abuse and to foster more positive social interactions among youth, however, there has been limited review of the literature on the outcomes of bystander programs. Therefore, this article provides an in-depth systematic literature review, which describes the content and program components of bystander programs and summarizes what is currently known about the impact of bystander interventions on participants’ behaviors and attitudes. Results indicate that bystander programs are promising from the standpoint of increasing young adults’ willingness to intervene and confidence in their ability to intervene when they witness dating or sexual violence, however, the utilization of actual bystander behaviors was less straightforward. Implications for prevention practice and for future research are presented.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1524838015584361,

Gender associated developmental trajectories of SDQ-dysregulation profile and its predictors in children,"Severe mood dysregulation is common in childhood and can be highly impairing. The Dysregulation Profile (DP) can be considered as a broader phenotype of emotional dysregulation, including affect, cognition and behaviour. Since mood dysregulation may persist, but differently in boys and girls, the gender associated course needs to be considered longitudinally to gain a better insight in order to support the children more adequately. This study is focusing on gender associated subgroup trajectories of the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire-Dysregulation Profile (SDQ-DP) in middle childhood (9-13 years of age) and includes the potential impact of clinical and psychosocial characteristics.The data set was available from the BELLA study on mental health and well-being in children and adolescents, which is the mental health module of the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS). A representative epidemiological sample of 564 children living in Germany was examined at three assessment points over 2 years (data collection 2003-2006). The SDQ-DP of children aged 9-13 years was evaluated using Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA).For both genders three trajectories with low (girls 67.0% and boys 59.5%), moderate (girls 28.0% and boys 31.7%) and high SDQ-DP (girls 5.0% and boys 8.8%) scores were detected. The courses of low and moderate subgroups were stable, while in the high SDQ-DP subgroup boys showed a decreasing and girls an increasing trend in symptom severity on a descriptive level. The results of the multinomial logistic regression analyses revealed a significant influence of mainly externalising but also internalising problems both increasing the risk of moderate and high SDQ-DP in both genders. Good quality of life was a protective factor for the SDQ-DP course in all subgroups.In addition to the known clinical and scientific value of the SDQ-DP, three distinguishable trajectories of SDQ-DP in boys and girls could be found. High externalising problems at the beginning of the trajectory were associated with an undesirable course of SDQ-DP. These findings might be helpful for better psychoeducation, counselling and monitoring in clinical cases and public health.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291717001714,
Parent–Adolescent Conflict across Adolescence: Trajectories of Informant Discrepancies and Associations with Personality Types,"Parent-adolescent conflict can be intense, yet parents and adolescents do not always agree on the intensity of conflict. Conflict intensity tends to change during adolescence and is thought to be an indicator of how the parent-adolescent relationship transforms. However, parents and adolescents might differently perceive change in conflict intensity, resulting in changing discrepancies in conflict intensity throughout adolescence. Also, personality characteristics of parents and adolescents might affect the extent to which there are discrepancies in perceptions of conflict intensity. This multi-informant longitudinal study investigated a) the trajectories of parent-adolescent conflict intensity, b) the trajectories of informant discrepancies, and c) the prediction of these trajectories by parental and adolescent personality. Dutch adolescents (N = 497, 43.1% female, Mage = 13.03 at T1), their mothers, and their fathers reported on parent-adolescent conflict intensity and personality for six years. Latent Growth Curve Modeling and Latent Congruence Modeling revealed curvilinear changes in conflict intensity, as well as in discrepancies thereof. Two cycles of discrepancies emerged. First, in early-to-middle-adolescence discrepancies in perceptions of parents and adolescents increased, reflecting that adolescents' perceived conflict intensity increased. Second, in middle-to-late-adolescence, father-adolescent discrepancies increased further, reflecting that fathers' perceptions of conflict decreased. Resilient adolescents, mothers, and fathers reported lower levels of conflict intensity than Undercontrollers and Overcontrollers, but personality was not associated with the rate of change in conflict intensity. Finally, undercontrolling fathers and overcontrolling adolescents showed higher father-adolescent discrepancies. This study showed that parents and adolescents differentially perceive conflict intensity and that in the adolescent-father relationship, the extent of the differences depends on adolescent and father personality.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-019-01054-7,
Parenting and externalizing problem behavior in adolescence: Combining the strengths of variable-centered and person-centered approaches.,"Previous studies often assumed that parenting practices are similar across families. This assumption is difficult to hold, especially throughout adolescence, a period of major change for both adolescents and their parents. By combining a person-centered and a variable-centered approach, the present study adds to the literature by identifying trajectory classes in parenting behaviors and assessing their associations with externalizing problem behavior. The study aimed (a) to examine the existence of subgroups with different trajectories for five parenting dimensions (i.e., support, proactive control, punitive control, harsh punitive control, psychological control) in mothers and fathers separately, and (b) to assess whether membership of a subgroup is associated with the development of rule-breaking and aggressive behavior, respectively. The current study used four waves of data, with adolescents' age ranging from 12 to 18 years. Mothers (N = 747) and fathers (N = 645) reported on their own parenting behavior, whereas adolescent (N = 1,116) reported on externalizing problem behavior. Latent class growth analyses per parenting dimension showed that trajectory classes could be distinguished for support, proactive, punitive, and psychological control, but not harsh punitive control, and this for both mother and father. Conditional growth models per parenting dimension and per parent did not show different trajectories for aggressive and rule-breaking behavior across adolescence for the distinct parenting trajectories. However, analyses indicated that depending on the parenting trajectory, there was a difference in initial (Age 12) levels of problem behavior. Suggestions for additional research on longitudinal heterogeneity of parenting among mothers and fathers of adolescents are outlined.

Developmental Trajectories of Nonsuicidal Self‐Injury in Adolescence and Intrapersonal/Interpersonal Risk Factors,"This 3‐wave study investigated the developmental trajectories of nonsuicidal self‐injury ( NSSI ) and intrapersonal/interpersonal risk factors among 3,381 Chinese adolescents (56.2% females) aged from 13 to 17 years during a 1‐year period. Using an accelerated longitudinal design and latent class growth analysis, we identified four subgroups of NSSI trajectories: negligible (74.6%), experimental (12.8%), moderate decreasing (10.8%), and high fluctuating (1.9%). Adolescents reporting both intrapersonal (i.e., impulsive behaviors and depression) and interpersonal (i.e., unstable relationships and parental criticism) risk factors were significantly more likely to follow the latter three trajectories. The findings of this study suggest there is heterogeneity in NSSI development among adolescents and highlight the contributions of both intrapersonal and interpersonal risk factors in the engagement in NSSI .",https://doi.org/10.1111/jora.12273,
Attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder developmental trajectories related to parental expressed emotion.,"In the transition from childhood to adolescence, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) developmental trajectories diverge. Family environment, as indexed by parental expressed emotion, may moderate these trajectories. 388 children with ADHD and 127 controls were assessed using multi-informant, multimethod diagnostic procedures at up to 3 time points 1 year apart in an accelerated longitudinal design spanning ages 7-13 years. Latent-class growth analysis was used to identify developmental trajectories for parent- and teacher-rated ADHD and oppositional-defiant disorder (ODD) symptoms within the ADHD sample. Parental expressed emotion, criticism, and emotional overinvolvement were coded from a 5-min speech sample at 2 time points, 1 year apart, for 208 of these children and compared among ADHD trajectory groups.Parent-rated hyperactivity yielded a 4-class trajectory solution in latent-class growth analysis; teacher-rated inattention yielded a 3-trajectory solution. Teacher-rated ODD also yielded 3-trajectory solution. A parent-rated high persistent hyperactive group was more likely than the other ADHD groups to have parents with stable high criticism (34.6%, p < .001), with ODD symptoms controlled. A teacher-identified high ODD-worsening group was more likely to experience high criticism, particularly the initial time point; (87.5%, p < .001), with hyperactivity controlled. Parental criticism, an index of the family environment, is uniquely associated with divergent developmental trajectories among children with ADHD in addition to those associated with ODD symptoms. Lay summary: For many children, ADHD symptoms decrease as they transition to adolescence. Family environmental factors, such as parental criticism, may help explain for whom symptom remission is less likely.",https://doi.org/10.1037/abn0000097,
Dark personality traits and impulsivity among adolescents: Differential links to problem behaviors and family relations.,"Research on how dark personality traits develop and relate to risky behaviors and family relations during adolescence is scarce. This study used a person-oriented approach to examine (a) whether distinct groups of adolescents could be identified based on their developmental profiles of callous-unemotional (CU), grandiose manipulative (GM), and dysfunctional impulsivity (DI) traits and (b) whether these groups differ in their problem behaviors and parent-adolescent relationship quality. Latent class growth analyses on 4-wave data of 1,131 Dutch adolescents revealed 3 personality profiles: (1) a dark impulsive group (13.9%), with high scores on all 3 traits (CU, GM, and DI) that were stable over time; (2) an impulsive group (26.1%), with high and increasing levels of impulsivity and relatively low scores on CU and GM; and (3) and a low risk group (60.0%), with relatively low levels on all 3 personality characteristics, with impulsivity decreasing over time. Compared with adolescents in the low risk group, adolescents in the dark impulsive and impulsive groups reported higher initial levels of substance use, sexual risk behaviors, permissive sexual attitudes, parent-adolescent conflict, and lower parent-adolescent satisfaction, as well as greater increases in sexual risk behavior over time. Compared with adolescents in the impulsive group, those in the dark impulsive group showed the highest levels of risk behaviors. Hence, dark personality traits coupled with impulsivity may be indicative of an earlier and more severe trajectory of problem behaviors that may differ from the trajectory of youth who are only impulsive.

Developmental Course and Risk Factors of Physical Aggression in Late Adolescence,"Abstract This study examined risk factors of physical aggression during transition from early to late adolescence using a two-wave longitudinal study. Specifically, we examined if risk factors in early adolescence predict physically aggressive behavior starting in late adolescence and why some adolescents desist physical aggressive behavior while others do not. The study sample consisted of 2289 Norwegian adolescents (1235 girls) who participated in the Young-HUNT1 study (mean age 14.5) and the follow-up study 4 years later, Young-HUNT2 study (mean age 18.4). One in six young adolescents reported engaging in physical fights. Moreover, physical aggression in early adolescence was significantly associated with male gender, attention problems, academic problems, being bullied, drinking alcohol, and smoking. Male gender and heavy drinking during early adolescence increased the risk for newly emerging aggressive behavior in late adolescence, whereas heavy drinking during early adolescence was a predictor for persistent versus desisting aggressive behavior in late adolescence.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10578-020-01049-7,
"A Longitudinal Study of Spirituality, Character Strengths, Subjective Well-Being, and Prosociality in Middle School Adolescents","Using data from 1,352 middle-school Israeli adolescents, the current study examines the interface of spirituality and character strengths and its longitudinal contribution to subjective well-being and prosociality. Participants were approached three times over a 14-months period and completed measures of character strengths, spirituality, subjective well-being (positive emotions, life satisfaction), and prosociality. Findings revealed a fourth-factor structure of character strengths that included the typical tripartite classification of intrapersonal, interpersonal, and intellectual strengths together with spirituality emerging as a statistically autonomous factor. Spirituality was stable over time and contributed to higher subjective well-being and prosociality both cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Discussion focuses on spirituality as a fundamental character strength and an important aspect of positive development.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2019.00377,
The course of problematic social media use in young adolescents: A latent class growth analysis,"Abstract Using four waves of longitudinal data collected in 2015–2019 from 1419 Dutch adolescents ( M age = 12.5, 45.9% female, 21.9% immigrant), this study identified trajectories of problematic social media use (SMU) in parallel with trajectories of SMU frequency. Latent class growth analysis identified two subgroups with relatively high levels of problematic SMU over time: One showed high (24.7%) and one showed average SMU frequency (15.8%). Also, two subgroups with persistently low levels of problematic SMU were identified: One reported low (22.4%) and one reported high SMU frequency (37.1%). Although both subgroups with high levels of problematic SMU reported low subjective well‐being, the group with high SMU frequency showed low self‐control, whereas the group with average SMU frequency reported poor social competencies.",https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.13712,
Modeling the Changes in Delinquent Behavior of Adolescents Transitioning into Adulthood: Methods Comparison with Simulated Data and Pathways to Desistance Data,"Various methods are available to model longitudinal data, for example, growth mixture modeling (GMM), latent class growth analysis (LCGA), k-means cluster analysis, and latent transition analysis (LTA).However, the extent to which different methods can adequately model different types of longitudinal data remains unclear.Using a set of simulated data, the current study evaluated how well the four methods perform under various simulation conditions.The extent to which the methods were able to i) accurately identify the number of latent classes, and ii) correctly assign individuals into their corresponding latent classes in the simulated data were compared with one another.Based on the simulation results, suggestions were made with respect to which method(s) were best applied to model the heterogeneity of longitudinal data.The present study further applies the methods of interest to model the changes in offending behavior as delinquent youths mature into young adults.Similarities and differences of modeling solutions from different methods are reported; recommendations are made for the exploration of inter-and intra-individual differences in longitudinal data.4.8 Average self-report offending scores for each latent class in each measurement time points. . . . . . . . . .",https://doi.org/10.18130/v3rp01,
Mental Health Before and During the COVID-19 Pandemic: A Longitudinal Probability Sample Survey of the UK Population,"Background: There is growing global concern about the potential impact of the Covid-19 pandemic on population mental health. We examine changes in adult mental health in the UK population before and during the lockdown. Methods: Secondary analysis of the UK Household Longitudinal Study Waves 6 (2014/15) to 9 (2018/19), matched to the Covid-19 web-survey completed by 17,452 panel members 23-29 April 2020. Mental health was assessed using the 12-item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ). Repeated cross-sectional analyses were conducted to examine annual temporal trends. Fixed effects regression models were fitted to identify within-person change compared to preceding trends. Findings: Mean population GHQ-12 score increased from 11·5 (95% confidence interval: 11·3–11·6) in 2018/19 to 12·6 (12·5–12·8) in April 2020, one month into lockdown. This was 0·48 (0·07-0·90) points higher than expected when accounting for prior upward trends between 2013 and 2019. Comparing scores within-individuals, adjusting for time-trends and predictors, increases were greatest in 18-24-year-olds (2·7, 1·89-3·48), 25-34-year-olds (1·6, 0·96-2·18), women (0·9, 0·50-1·35), and people living with young children (1·45, 0·79-2·12). People employed before the pandemic averaged a notable increase (0·6; 0·20-1·06). Interpretation: In late April 2020, mental health in the UK deteriorated compared to trends pre-Covid, particularly in young people, women and those living with young children. Those in employment before the pandemic also experienced greater deterioration one month into lockdown, perhaps due to actual or anticipated redundancy. While deterioration occurred across income groups, we anticipate inequalities may widen over time, as in other causes of recessions.Funding Statement: This study was unfunded.Declaration of Interests: The authors declare no competing interests.

Levels of Severity of Depressive Symptoms Among At-Risk Groups in the UK During the COVID-19 Pandemic,"<h3>Importance</h3> An immediate research priority is to investigate and monitor the psychological well-being among high-risk groups during the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. <h3>Objective</h3> To examine levels of severity of depressive symptoms over time among individuals with high risk in the UK during the COVID-19 pandemic. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cohort study is part of an ongoing large panel study of adults aged 18 years and older residing in the UK, the COVID-19 Social Study, established on March 21, 2020. Data analysis was conducted in May 2020. <h3>Exposures</h3> Sociodemographic risk factors included belonging to the Black, Asian, and minority racial/ethnic communities, low socioeconomic position (SEP), and essential worker roles (eg, workers in health and social care, education, childcare, or key public services). Health-related and psychosocial risk factors included preexisting physical and mental health conditions, experience of psychological or physical abuse, and low social support. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Depressive symptoms were measured on 7 occasions from March 21 to April 2, 2020, using the 9-item Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ-9). Group-based depressive symptom trajectories were derived using latent growth mixture modeling. <h3>Results</h3> The analytical sample comprised 51 417 adults aged 18 years and older (mean [SD] age, 48.8 [16.8] years; 26 276 [51.1%] women; 6145 members [12.0%] of Black, Asian, and minority racial/ethnic communities). Among these, 17 143 participants (33.3%) were in the lowest SEP quartile, and 11 342 participants (22.1%) were classified as essential workers. Three levels of severity of depressive symptoms were identified: low (30 850 participants [60.0%]), moderate (14 911 participants [29.0%]), and severe (5656 participants [11.0%]). After adjusting for covariates, experiences of physical or psychological abuse (odds ratio [OR], 13.16; 95% CI, 12.95-13.37;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), preexisting mental health conditions (OR, 12.99; 95% CI, 12.87-13.11;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), preexisting physical health conditions (OR, 3.41; 95% CI, 3.29-3.54;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), low social support (OR, 12.72; 95% CI, 12.57-12.86;<i>P</i> &lt; .001), and low SEP (OR, 5.22; 95% CI, 5.08-5.36;<i>P</i> &lt; .001) were significantly associated with severe depressive symptoms. No significant association was found for race/ethnicity (OR, 1.07; 95% CI, 0.85-1.28;<i>P</i> = .56). Participants with essential worker roles were less likely to experience severe depressive symptoms (OR, 0.66; 95% CI, 0.53-0.80;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). Similar patterns of associations were found for the group of participants with moderate depressive symptoms (abuse: OR, 5.34; 95% CI, 5.15-5.54;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; mental health condition: OR, 4.24; 95% CI, 4.24-4.24;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; physical health condition: OR, 1.89; 95% CI, 1.80-1.98;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; low social support: OR, 4.71; 95% CI, 4.60-4.82;<i>P</i> &lt; .001; low SEP: OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.87-2.08;<i>P</i> &lt; .001). <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> In this cohort study of UK adults participating in the COVID-19 Social Study, people with psychosocial and health-related risk factors, as well as those with low SEP, were at the most risk of experiencing moderate or severe depressive symptoms during the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2020.26064,
Direct Aggression and Generalized Anxiety in Adolescence: Heterogeneity in Development and Intra-Individual Change,"Co-occurrence of aggression and anxiety might change during adolescence, or stay stable. We studied change and stability of four types of co-occurrence regarding direct aggression and anxiety in adolescence: an anxious and non-aggressive type, an aggressive and non-anxious type, a comorbid aggressive-anxious type and a no problems type. We applied a person-centered approach to assess increases and decreases of these types, and tested various models of intra-individual change of the types: the stability, acting out and failure models. We used data from a five-wave study of 923 early-to-middle and 390 middle-to-late adolescents (48.5 % male), thereby covering the ages of 12–20. We observed accelerated development in the older cohort: adolescents tended to grow faster out of the aggressive types in middle-to-late adolescence than in early-to-middle adolescence. We observed one other group-dependent pattern of heterogeneity in development, namely ""gender differentiation"": gender differences in aggression and generalized anxiety became stronger over time. We found support for two perspectives on intra-individual change of the four types, namely the stability and the acting out perspective. The no problems—and to a lesser extent the anxious—type proved to be stable across time. Acting out was found in early-to-middle adolescents, males, and adolescents with poorer-quality friendships. In all three groups, there were substantial transitions from the anxious type to the aggressive type during 4 years (between 20 and 41 %). Remarkably, acting out was most prevalent in subgroups that, generally speaking, are more vulnerable for aggressive behavior, namely early-to-middle adolescents and males. We interpret acting out as the attempt of adolescents to switch from anxiety to instrumental aggression, in order to become more visible and obtain an autonomous position in the adolescent world. Acting out contributed to the explanation of accelerated development and gender differentiation. We also observed an increase of adolescents with no problems. These findings highlight that the co-occurrence of aggression and anxiety changes considerably during adolescence, but also that the anxious and no problems types are quite stable in this period.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-015-0388-8,
The influence of parents and schools on developmental trajectories of antisocial behaviors in Caucasian and African American youths,"Abstract African American youths are overrepresented in the American juvenile justice system relative to Caucasians. Yet, research on antisocial behaviors (ASB) has focused on predominantly Caucasian populations. Furthermore, relatively little is known about how environmental factors, such as supportive parenting (e.g., how close adolescents feel to their parent) and school connectedness (e.g., how supported adolescents feel at school), affect trajectories of ASB in Caucasians versus African Americans. This study mapped developmental trajectories of ASB in Caucasians ( n = 10,764) and African Americans ( n = 4,091) separately, using four waves of data from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health. We then examined supportive parenting and school connectedness on the trajectories of ASB. Four trajectories of ASB were identified for both Caucasians and African Americans: negligible, adolescence-peaked, low-persistence, and high-persistence ASB, although prevalence rates differed by racial-ethnic status. Supportive parenting reduced the risk of membership into the adolescence-peaked trajectory for both Caucasians and African Americans. However, school connectedness was less protective for African Americans than for Caucasians because it only predicted a lower risk of adolescence-peaked membership for African Americans. Findings may reflect the complex social dynamics between race and schools in the development of ASB.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579418001335,
Analyzing the Heterogeneous Nature of Inmate Behavior: Trajectories of Prison Misconduct,"Researchers have long been interested in stability and changes in offending patterns between and within individuals during the life-course. Using data from the Oregon Department of Corrections and the Oregon State Police, the current study explores misconduct trajectories and also attempts to determine whether certain preprison inmate characteristics specified in the importation model are associated with various misconduct trajectories. Results indicate that there are subgroups of inmates engaged in different patterns of institutional misconduct during the course of years of imprisonment. In addition, certain inmate characteristics can be used to explain the identified heterogeneity in inmate misconduct. Findings from trajectory analyses can be useful to prison officials and policy makers when planning prison services, assistance, and programming for subgroups of inmates.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0032885517711420,
"Defending victimized peers: Opposing the bully, supporting the victim, or both?","To reduce bullying, more knowledge on children defending their victimized peers is critical. In previous work, predominantly cross‐sectional in nature, defending has typically been operationalized as one single, broad construct. However, there are good reasons to assume that attacking the bully (bully oriented defending) and comforting the victim (victim‐oriented defending) are relatively independent constructs, with potentially different correlates. This longitudinal study in the Netherlands ( N = 394; M age = 10.3) combined person‐ and variable‐centered techniques to examine relations between two different forms of defending and multiple outcome variables. In addition to the largest group scoring low on both types of defending, three subgroups emerged. A small group of “traditional,” predominantly female defenders, scored high on both forms of defending. These children were well liked and high in reputation‐based status, as indexed by perceived popularity and resource control. A larger, predominantly female second group only scored high on victim‐oriented defending. These children were also well liked, but low in reputation‐based status. The third group only scored high on bully oriented defending, and predominantly contained boys. These children were high in reputation‐based status but quite disliked, and they scored high on bullying. Findings strongly suggest that bully oriented defending does not in all cases reflect desirable interventions of empathic children. Aggr.

Latent developmental trajectories of episodic heavy drinking from adolescence to early adulthood: Predictors of trajectory groups and alcohol problems in early adulthood as outcome,"Abstract Introduction and Aims. To identify latent developmental episodic heavy drinking (EHD) trajectory groups for Norwegian adolescents, investigate risk factors associated with group membership and to assess differences in alcohol problems between different groups in early adulthood. Design and Methods. Data were from 1266 individuals measured at four time points from age 13/14 years to age 26/27 years. Latent class growth analysis was used to identify groups with different EHD development. Multinomial logistic regression was used to investigated if gender, impulsivity, school commitment, parents' socio‐economic status, frequency of seeing parents drunk and parental knowledge could predict group membership. Differences in alcohol problem scores at age 26/27 were also assessed. Results. Four trajectory groups were identified: ‘stable high’, ‘early increasers’, ‘late increasers’ and ‘stable low’. Membership of the high‐risk trajectory groups ‘stable high’ and ‘early increasers’ was predicted by high impulsivity, low school commitment, high frequency of seeing parents drunk and low parental knowledge. The risk of alcohol problems at age 26/27 was greater for the ‘stable high’ group, the ‘early increasers’ and the ‘late increasers’ compared with the ‘stable low’ group. The ‘stable high’ and ‘early increasers’ had similar risk of alcohol problems. Discussion and Conclusions. Stable high and early increasing EHD in adolescence was associated with more alcohol problems in early adulthood. Such trajectories were predicted by high impulsivity, low school commitment, high frequency of seeing parents drunk and low parental knowledge. [Brunborg GS, Norström T, Storvoll EE.

Cultural Orientation Trajectories and Substance Use: Findings From a Longitudinal Study of Mexican‐Origin Youth,"Cultural adaptation may influence Latino youth substance use (SU) development, yet few longitudinal studies have examined cultural change over time and adolescent SU outcomes. Using longitudinal data collected annually across ages 10–16 from 674 Mexican‐origin youth (50% female), the authors characterized cultural adaptation patterns for language use (English and Spanish use), values (American values and familism values), and identity (ethnic pride), and examined whether these cultural adaptation patterns were associated with differential SU risk. Youth with increasing bilingualism and high/stable family values had lower SU risk compared to youth who primarily spoke English and endorsed decreasing family values, respectively. Ethnic pride trajectories were not associated with SU. Findings highlight the importance of considering cultural change related to Latino youth SU.",https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12586,
Identifying childhood predictors of delinquency escalations in adolescence,"A subset of youth show an escalation of delinquency in adolescence and there is considerable potential value in identifying early life markers that could be used to help target preventive interventions for those at risk. Within a dual systems framework, this study examined childhood predictors of adolescent escalations of delinquency in the normative z-proso cohort (n=1522). Trajectories were summarised using latent class growth analysis of self-reported sensation-seeking, self-regulation, and delinquency across ages 11 to 20. Predictors examined included task-based measures of risk-taking, and sensation-seeking at age 7/8 and parent- and teacher-reports of ADHD symptoms and a range of conduct problems at age 7. Adjusting for gender, all predictors except parented-reported indirect aggression, inattention, and hyperactivity/impulsivity symptoms were associated with membership in a class characterised by an adolescent escalation of delinquency (n=112; 7.4%) relative to a class with no escalation(n=816; 53.7%). Mutually adjusting for all predictors, gender, age 7 sensation seeking, age 8 risk-taking propensity, parent-reported physical aggression and teacher-reported reactive aggression emerged as unique significant predictors. Results suggest that later delinquency escalations can be predicted based on child characteristics at age 7/8 years of age. This knowledge could help to identify children who could benefit from preventive interventions",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ftzgm,
The Application of Latent Class Analysis for Investigating Population Child Mental Health: A Systematic Review,"Latent class analysis (LCA) can be used to identify subgroups of children with similar patterns of mental health symptoms and/or strengths.

Self-regulation as a predictor of patterns of change in externalizing behaviors from infancy to adolescence,"Abstract We examined associations between specific self-regulatory mechanisms and externalizing behavior patterns from ages 2 to 15 ( N = 443). The relation between multiple self-regulatory indicators across multiple domains (i.e., physiological, attentional, emotional, and behavioral) at age 2 and at age 5 and group membership in four distinct externalizing trajectories was examined. By examining each of these self-regulatory processes in combination with one another, and therefore accounting for their shared variance, we aimed to better understand which specific self-regulatory skills were associated most strongly with externalizing behavioral patterns. Findings suggest that behavioral inhibitory control and emotion regulation are particularly important in distinguishing between children who show normative declines in externalizing behaviors across early childhood and those who demonstrate high levels through adolescence.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579417000992,
Cyberbullying in the Era of Digital Relationships: The Unique Role of Resilience and Emotion Regulation on Adolescents’ Adjustment,"Purpose In this study, we aimed at examining the unique and interactive effects of peer violence in cyberspace on adolescents' emotion regulation and socioemotional adjustment, as well as the mediational role of resilience in the link between adolescent's pathogenic relational experiences and behavioral outcomes. Specifically, we intended to explore emotion differentiation and regulation in reaction to bullying perpetration and victimization and in terms of positive (proud, confident, good) and negative (ashamed, excited, guilty), Passive (sad, embarrassed, humiliated) and Reactive (angry, scared) emotions and how it impacted and predicted positive and negative outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1108/s1537-466120150000019001,
"Developmental pathways of adolescent cannabis use: Risk factors, outcomes and sex-specific differences","Characterizing patterns of adolescent cannabis use (CU), as well as risk factors and outcomes uniquely associated with these pathways is essential for informing treatment and prevention efforts. Yet, few studies have examined these issues among youth at-risk of engaging in problematic cannabis use. Further, research accounting for use of other substances or sex differences in patterns of CU remains exceedingly sparse.Trajectory-based modeling was used to identify underlying CU pathways among a predominantly Hispanic (90%) sample of at-risk youth (n = 401; 46% female) across adolescence (ages∼14-18), controlling for baseline substance use and participant demographics. Adolescent psychopathology (i.e., conduct disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, anxiety, and depression) was examined as a predictor and outcome of CU.Three trajectories of adolescent CU were identified, with most youth (74%) engaging in relatively ""low"" levels of use, followed by ∼12% exhibiting an early-initiating ""chronic"" course, and 14% ""escalating"" in use. Although boys and girls both experienced increased levels of CU across adolescence, boys were more likely to exhibit escalating and chronic patterns of use. Findings revealed unique associations between adolescent CU pathways and facets of psychopathology; most notably, the relatively robust and bidirectional association between CU trajectories and conduct problem symptoms.Specific facets of psychopathology may confer unique associations with CU across development, including the initiation and exacerbation of CU during adolescence.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2018.1517177,
Developmental Trajectories of Parental Knowledge During Early Adolescence and Their Psychosocial Predictors,"Recent studies revealed that parental knowledge of the child’s activities and whereabouts moderately declines during adolescence. This study investigated whether (a) there exist trajectory classes that considerably deviate from this average trend and (b) whether early psychosocial factors distinguish the trajectory subgroups. Analyses were based on a German sample of school students ( N = 715) who provided annual self-reports from age 10 to 14 years. Growth mixture modeling revealed two same-sized trajectory groups of parental knowledge that both displayed a moderate decline and were only distinguishable by different levels. Membership in the lower level group was associated with a difficult temperament, poor family relationships, problems with peers, and male gender. Contrary to other studies, findings indicated that trajectory classes of parental knowledge which substantially deviate from the normative decline do not exist. Sample characteristics, the focus on early adolescence, and a thorough application of growth mixture specifications may explain our findings.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0192513x15576965,
Recent advances in differentiating suicide attempters from suicide ideators,"Purpose of review This article summarizes findings from recent studies (published since 2015) examining differences between suicide attempters and suicide ideators. Recent findings Converging evidence suggests that the capability to attempt suicide (e.g., acquired capability, painful and provocative experiences, high tolerance for pain and distress) is higher in suicide attempters than suicide ideators. Other psychosocial and biological differences have also been identified but require replication. Summary Recent literature reviews find that traditional risk factors for suicide – such as depression, hopelessness, most psychiatric disorders, and even impulsivity – robustly predict suicide ideation but poorly predict suicide attempts among ideators. To address this knowledge gap, studies are increasingly employing an ideation-to-action framework. This framework views the development of suicide ideation and the progression from ideation to potentially lethal attempts as distinct processes with distinct explanations and predictors. Converging evidence suggests that factors associated with diminished fear of pain, injury, and death can increase one's capability to attempt suicide and facilitate the progression from suicidal thoughts to suicidal acts. Recent studies have also identified other variables that may differentiate attempters from ideators, but these require replication. Theories of suicide positioned within the ideation-to-action framework provide testable and promising hypotheses about the progression from ideation to attempts. These include the Interpersonal Theory, Integrated Motivational-Volitional Model, and Three-Step Theory.",https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0000000000000294,

We deploy group trajectory analysis (exploring spatial autocorrelation with Local Moran's I) and comparison of means to explore the underlying characteristics and trajectories of neighbourhoods over time. The research finds marked distinction in the level of crime and trajectories of different neighbourhood crime groups. Neighbourhood crime trajectories with high or low levels of crime exhibit spatial clustering and significant distinction in their characteristics. There is more limited spatial patterning, though still clear distinction between the characteristics of neighbourhood crime groups that exhibit different crime trajectories.

Bivariate Trajectories of Substance Use and Antisocial Behavior,"Substance use and antisocial behavior (ASB) are complex and interrelated behaviors. This study identified model trajectory classes defined by concurrent substance use and ASB and examined trajectory associations with emerging adult outcomes. Participants from a high-risk sample of youth ( n = 536; 73% male) completed interviews at baseline (mean age = 16.1 years) and follow-up (mean age = 22.6 years). Latent class growth analyses identified five trajectory classes based on alcohol/drug use (AOD) and ASB, namely, dual chronic, increasing AOD/persistent ASB, persistent AOD/adolescent ASB, decreasing drugs/persistent ASB, and resolved. Many individuals (56%) exhibited elevated/increasing AOD, and most (91%) reported ASB decreases. Those associated with the dual chronic class had the highest rates of substance dependence, antisocial personality disorder, and negative psychosocial outcomes. There were no differences in adult role attainment across classes. Conjoint examination of these behaviors provides greater detail regarding clinical course and can inform secondary prevention and intervention efforts.",https://doi.org/10.1177/2167696815573791,
2. Methodological approaches to modeling criminal trajectories,"Criminal offenders compose a heterogeneous population. Criminal trajectory research aims to capture this heterogeneity in terms of the frequency or severity of offending. This chapter describes the concept a criminal trajectory and the statistical technique used to derive trajectories from longitudinal data. Both the semiparametric group-based trajectory modeling (SGBTM) and latent growth mixture modeling (GMM) approaches are described in nontechnical terms, and the differences between them are noted. Despite some similarities, these approaches are also distinguished from conventional growth curve modeling. Guidelines and factors to consider in building and testing trajectory models are discussed. Last, extensions of SGBTM and GMM are presented.",https://doi.org/10.18574/nyu/9781479880058.003.0003,
Variance constraints strongly influenced model performance in growth mixture modeling: a simulation and empirical study,"Abstract Background Growth Mixture Modeling (GMM) is commonly used to group individuals on their development over time, but convergence issues and impossible values are common. This can result in unreliable model estimates. Constraining variance parameters across classes or over time can solve these issues, but can also seriously bias estimates if variances differ. We aimed to determine which variance parameters can best be constrained in Growth Mixture Modeling. Methods To identify the variance constraints that lead to the best performance for different sample sizes, we conducted a simulation study and next verified our results with the TRacking Adolescent Individuals’ Lives Survey (TRAILS) cohort. Results If variance parameters differed across classes and over time, fitting a model without constraints led to the best results. No constrained model consistently performed well. However, the model that constrained the random effect variance and residual variances across classes consistently performed very poorly. For a small sample size ( N = 100) all models showed issues. In TRAILS, the same model showed substantially different results from the other models and performed poorly in terms of model fit. Conclusions If possible, a Growth Mixture Model should be fit without any constraints on variance parameters. If not, we recommend to try different variance specifications and to not solely rely on the default model, which constrains random effect variances and residual variances across classes. The variance structure must always be reported Researchers should carefully follow the GRoLTS-Checklist when analyzing and reporting trajectory analyses.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12874-020-01154-0,
"Different Paths, Different Patterns","This chapter shows the criminal trajectories of offenders whose life paths have been studied since the 2000s. It covers more than 1,800 people of different ages from the millennial generation. They began committing crimes in the late 1990s and in 2000 as juveniles. Each of their stories begins as a case in a juvenile court. Further research showed that some of them had continued to commit crimes in adulthood. Others, according to the 'aging out' concept, had grown out of criminal activity or discontinued their life of crime. Based on the data about the crimes committed by the perpetrators in adulthood and using latent class growth analysis method, the researchers defined six different crime trajectories: non-offenders and adolescence-peaked high, adolescence-peaked low, late-peaked, persistent, and intermittent offenders. The analysis of these six different types of trajectories includes such variables as the age of onset of a criminal career, duration of that career, and number of crimes committed in every year. For this purpose, several data sources were used: the National Criminal Register provides information on the dates of convictions for specific acts and thus allows the analysis of criminal trajectories; information was also acquired from the files of the courts.",https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003332565-5,
Ensnarement During Imprisonment,"Research Summary We used data collected during the Evaluation of Ohio's Prison Programs. The analytical sample of N = 63,772 inmates represents one of the largest samples used to assess the association between within‐prison sanctioning and recidivism. Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) demonstrated that five guilty sanctioning clusters existed within the data: Persistent (0.72%), Very High Decline (0.11%), High Decline (1.38%), Moderate Decline (27.03%), and Abstainers (70.75%). The examination of sanctioning cluster classification on post‐release recidivism suggested that greater exposure to formal sanctions during imprisonment predicted recidivism 1, 2, and 3 years post‐release. Policy Implications The outcome of the empirical analysis suggested an association between within‐prison sanctioning clusters and recidivism. Furthermore, longitudinal sanctioning clusters exposed to higher levels of within‐prison sanctioning possessed a greater probability of recidivism 1, 2, and 3 years post‐release. If replicated, two policy implications could be derived from the contextualization of these results within the ensnarement framework. First, it is recommended that the frequency and severity of sanctions be reduced, to the extent possible, during imprisonment. Second, increased access to prosocial opportunities (e.g., rehabilitation programs) during sanctioning efforts is also encouraged based on the analyses.",https://doi.org/10.1111/1745-9133.12397,
Sense of Coherence in Young People with Congenital Heart Disease,"Patient-reported outcomes (PROs) have been found to play a role in the development of clinical complications. Hence, it is crucial to understand why some patients do well in terms of PROs and others do not and to identify these groups of patients. Sense of coherence (SOC), capturing a person's outlook on life, is associated with PROs in adolescents with congenital heart disease (CHD). Therefore, we (1) examine how SOC develops in young people with CHD, (2) identify subgroups of SOC development, and (3) characterize subgroups in terms of demographic and clinical variables and PROs.In this 4-wave longitudinal study, 429 adolescents with CHD (53.4% boys; median age = 16.3 years) completed assessments of SOC (SOC-13). PROs included quality of life (linear analog scale), loneliness (UCLA-8), depression (CES-D), and perceived health (PedsQL). Latent class growth analysis was used to identify clinically meaningful subgroups of SOC development.Patients with CHD had a moderate SOC that slightly decreased over the first 18 months. Four subgroups of SOC development emerged: Consistently High (27%), Intermediate Stable (41%), Intermediate Decreasing (25%), and Chronically Low (7%). Subgroups differed in terms of sex and PROs, but not in terms of age, disease complexity, primary diagnosis, or surgical history.Patients with a strong and stable SOC over time showed a better adaptation than patients with a lower and/or decreasing SOC. Our results can guide the identification of patients at risk for adverse health outcomes and the development of interventions to enhance optimal living in patients with CHD.",https://doi.org/10.1097/dbp.0000000000000147,
Trajectories of Substance Use among Child Welfare-Involved Youth: Longitudinal Associations with Child Maltreatment History and Emotional/Behavior Problems,"Background: Maltreated children experience a variety of adverse outcomes including substance use problems. Although previous research indicated that there may be distinct trajectories of substance use among these youth, studies have examined them as if they were a single homogeneous group. Objectives: The goals of this study were to explore substance use trajectories among child welfare-involved youth and to identify characteristics that distinguish substance use trajectories. Methods: Data from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-Being (NSCAW II) were used. Multilevel latent growth mixture modeling (MLGMM) was performed using a subsample of 625 youth from ages 11–17 years investigated for maltreatment in 2008–2009. Measures included self-reported use of substance use during the previous 30 days, demographic characteristics, maltreatment history, placement in out-of-home care, and behavioral health problems. Results: MLGMM identified two distinct substance use trajectory classes including High Stable Substance Use and Rapid Progression Use. Findings suggest that the experience of physical abuse is the key factor that distinguishes the two groups. When the effects of class-specific covariates were examined, results suggest that involvement in substance use behavior and its escalation vary between groups and are affected by youth's different previous experiences. Conclusions/Importance: The results have important implications for understanding individual differences in substance use behavior over time and how these differences were shaped by youth's experiences of family adversity. Study findings may be helpful for developing and enhancing the effectiveness of interventions targeted at decreasing substance use behaviors in child welfare-involved youth.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2018.1504079,
Social anxiety and alcohol use across the university years: Adaptive and maladaptive groups.,"University/college can be a challenging time as students face developmental tasks such as building new social networks and achieving academically. Social anxiety may be disadvantageous in this setting given that social situations often include drinking and individuals with social anxiety tend to self-medicate through alcohol use. However, findings are mixed as to whether the association between social anxiety and alcohol use is positive or negative. To clarify the nature of this association, we used a person-centered longitudinal analysis to identify student groups based on levels of social anxiety symptoms and alcohol consumption. Undergraduates (N = 1132, 70.5% female, Mage = 19.06 at Time 1) enrolled in university completed a survey assessing social anxiety and alcohol use over 3 years, and psychosocial functioning and emotion coping behaviors at Time 1. Two out of 5 groups were identified with higher levels of social anxiety, 1 with moderately low alcohol use, and the other with moderately high alcohol use. Both groups reported higher levels of general anxiety, depressive symptoms, behavioral inhibition, emotional reactivity, daily hassles, and lower levels of social ties at Time 1 than the 3 groups with lower levels of social anxiety. Furthermore, the social anxiety-alcohol use group reported significantly lower academic grades and was more likely to endorse problematic emotion coping behaviors (e.g., self-injury) than the social anxiety-low alcohol use group. These results not only help explain the mixed findings in the literature but indicate that 1 group of socially anxious students may be particularly vulnerable to negative adjustment difficulties.

Exploring Heterogeneity in perinatal depression: a comprehensive review,"Abstract Perinatal depression (PND) is a significant contributor to maternal morbidity globally. Recognized as a major cause of poor infant development, epidemiological and interventional research on it has increased over the last decade. Recently, studies have pointed out that PND is a heterogeneous condition, with variability in its phenotypes, rather than a homogenous latent entity and a concrete diagnosis, as previously conceptualized in psychometric literature and diagnostic systems. Therefore, it is pertinent that researchers recognize this to progress in elucidating its aetiology and developing efficacious interventions. This systematic review is conducted in accordance with the Meta-analysis of observational studies in epidemiology (MOOSE). It aims to provide an updated and comprehensive account of research on heterogeneity in phenotypes of PND and its implications in research, public health, and clinical practice. It provides a synthesis and quality assessment of studies reporting heterogeneity in PND using cutting-edge statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. After reporting the phenotypes of PND, based on heterogeneous trajectories and symptom profiles, it also elucidates the risk factors associated with severe forms of PND, followed by robust evidence for adverse child outcomes. Furthermore, recommendations are made to improve public health and clinical practice in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of PND.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-023-05121-z,
Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Trajectories Among Children After Disaster Exposure: A Review,"Abstract Natural disasters, such as hurricanes and floods, are increasing in frequency and scope. Youth exposed to disasters are at risk for developing posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS). However, not all youth who report initially elevated PTSS report persistent PTSS that last beyond the first three to six months postdisaster. Thus, it is crucial to understand how and why youth differ in their patterns of PTSS. This study reviewed the literature on children's postdisaster PTSS, evaluating the typical number and types of patterns for children's PTSS trajectories, as well as risk and protective factors predicting trajectory membership. This review identified eight empirical studies on youth PTSS trajectories following natural disasters; these studies included 8,306 children aged 3 to 18 years. All studies identified resilience, recovery, and chronic trajectories. Evidence for a delayed trajectory was mixed. Proportions of children falling into each trajectory varied widely across studies, but overall, resilience was the most prevalent trajectory. These findings were consistent across study factors (i.e., analytic strategy, assessment timing, and study selection criteria). Female gender, disaster exposure, negative coping, and lack of social support were significant risk factors for chronic trajectories across several studies. Future research should combine individual level participant data across studies of children's responses to disasters to better understand PTSS trajectories.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22242,
Predictors of Patterns of Alcohol-Related Blackouts Over Time in Youth From the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism: The Roles of Genetics and Cannabis,"Alcohol-related blackouts (ARBs) are anterograde amnesias related to heavy alcohol intake seen in about 50% of drinkers. Although a major determinant of ARBs relates to blood alcohol concentrations, additional contributions come from genetic vulnerabilities and possible impacts of cannabis use disorders (CUDs). We evaluated relationships of genetics and cannabis use to latent class trajectories of ARBs in 829 subjects from the Collaborative Study of the Genetics of Alcoholism (COGA).The number of ARBs experienced every 2 years from subjects with average ages of 18 to 25 were entered into a latent class growth analysis in Mplus, and resulting class membership was evaluated in light of baseline characteristics, including CUDs. Correlations of number of ARBs across assessments were also compared for sibling pairs versus unrelated subjects.Latent class growth analysis identified ARB-based Classes 1 (consistent low = 42.5%), 2 (moderate low = 28.3%), 3 (moderate high = 22.9%), and 4 (consistent high = 6.3%). A multinomial logistic regression analysis within latent class growth analysis revealed that baseline CUDs related most closely to Classes 3 and 4. The number of ARBs across time correlated .23 for sibling pairs and -.10 for unrelated subjects.Baseline CUDs related to the most severe latent ARB course over time, even when considered along with other trajectory predictors, including baseline alcohol use disorders and maximum number of drinks. Data indicated significant roles for genetic factors for alcohol use disorder patterns over time. Future research is needed to improve understanding of how cannabis adds to the ARB risk and to find genes that contribute to risks for ARBs among drinkers.",https://doi.org/10.15288/jsad.2017.78.39,
Group‐Based Trajectory Modeling of Marital Quality: A Critical Review,"The predominant view in both the research literature and practice is that marital quality declines over time. Although the majority of research using variable‐centered approaches such as latent growth curve modeling supports this view, contemporary research using person‐centered group‐based trajectory modeling techniques suggest a variety of trajectories of marital quality development, including stability, decline, and, occasionally, rebound following decline. The present review synthesizes this current body of research and summarizes the variety of trajectories found across 14 reports examining both positive and negative marital quality dimensions. The theories informing this body of research and the predictors of the various trajectories are also reviewed. We conclude with a discussion of methodological and practical implications of the findings to date and introduce the honeymoon‐as‐ceiling effect, a phrase we use to capture the consistent finding that marital quality rarely increases beyond its initial value.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jftr.12201,
Early Predictors of Delinquency in Middle School Students,"Objectives The purpose of this study is to classify middle school students accoring to the change of their delinquency measures and to find predictors of delinquency among variables in their 6th grade. Methods Using Gyeonggi Education Panel Study(GEPS) data for the elementary students panel from 3th year(6th grade in elementary school) to 6th year(3rd grade in middle school), latent growth mixture modeling was applied to classfy middle school students' pattern of delinquency changes, and multinomial logistic regression was conducted to find predictor variables. Results With latent growth mixture analyses, three latent classes were identified: ‘decreasing from high level’, ‘increasing from low level’, and ‘low-level’. The probability of class membership was significantly predicted by gender, physical self-concept, academic achievement, parental attachment, parental monitoring, and peer relationship. Conclusions It was suggested to develop a policy-based support system to affect variables in elementary school that predicts students' delinquency in middle school and that teachers in elementary schools can detect easily. Specifically, an early intervention for students with low academic achievement was suggested as an effective approach to prevent delinquency.",https://doi.org/10.22251/jlcci.2023.23.7.525,
Trajectories of marijuana use from late childhood to late adolescence: Can Temperament × Experience interactions discriminate different trajectories of marijuana use?,"Abstract Informed by developmental ecological and epigenetic theory, the current study examined three aims concerning adolescent marijuana use with a large community sample ( N = 755; gender = 53% female) and six annual assessments that spanned 11–18 years of age. First, the natural history of adolescent marijuana use was modeled using a two-part latent growth curve analysis. Second, the validity of the mixtures was examined with a broad array of known correlates of adolescent marijuana use. Third, temperament (e.g., surgency, effortful control, and negative affect) was tested as individual differences that would enter into statistical interactions with peer substance use and prior alcohol and cigarette use to distinguish trajectories of marijuana use. The results suggested that escalations in marijuana use were observed for some youth who initiated marijuana use early in adolescence. Youth whose marijuana use did escalate substantially (10%) were distinguished on temperament, conduct disorder, peer delinquency, and pubertal development at baseline. Furthermore, hypothesized interactions between surgency and both peer substance use and prior substance use discriminated different patterns of marijuana use. The findings are discussed with respect to strategies for timing and content of preventive interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579416000468,
Effects of cumulative trauma load on long-term trajectories of life satisfaction and health in a population-based study,"Abstract Background Lifetime traumatic events are known to have a detrimental long-term impact on both mental and physical health. Yet, heterogeneity in the stress response regarding well-being in adults is not well understood. This study investigates effects of cumulative trauma on latent trajectories of two indices of well-being, subjective health and life satisfaction in a large representative sample by means of latent variable modelling techniques. Methods Data from the pairfam study wave 2–9, a longitudinal representative survey was used ( N = 10,825). Individuals reported on lifetime trauma type exposure on wave 7 and indicated levels of life satisfaction and health at each wave. Different types of latent Variable Mixture Models were applied in an iterative fashion. Conditional models investigated effects of cumulative trauma load. Results The best fitting model indicated three latent trajectories for life, and four for health, respectively. Trauma load significantly predicted class membership: Higher exposure was associated with non-stable trajectories for both indices but followed complex patterns of both improving and decreasing life satisfaction and health. Trauma load also explained variability within classes. Conclusions The current study expands on evidence to the long-term development of health and life satisfaction in response to traumatic events from a latent variable modelling perspective. Besides detrimental effect, it also points to functional adaptation after initial decline and increased well-being associated with trauma exposure. Thus, response to traumatic stress is marked by great heterogeneity. Future research should focus on variables beyond exposure to trauma that can further identify individuals prone to trajectories of declining well-being.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12889-020-09663-9,
"Data Science in the Research Domain Criteria Era: Relevance of Machine Learning to the Study of Stress Pathology, Recovery, and Resilience","Diverse environmental and biological systems interact to influence individual differences in response to environmental stress. Understanding the nature of these complex relationships can enhance the development of methods to: (1) identify risk, (2) classify individuals as healthy or ill, (3) understand mechanisms of change, and (4) develop effective treatments. The Research Domain Criteria (RDoC) initiative provides a theoretical framework to understand health and illness as the product of multiple inter-related systems but does not provide a framework to characterize or statistically evaluate such complex relationships. Characterizing and statistically evaluating models that integrate multiple levels (e.g. synapses, genes, environmental factors) as they relate to outcomes that a free from prior diagnostic benchmarks represents a challenge requiring new computational tools that are capable to capture complex relationships and identify clinically relevant populations. In the current review, we will summarize machine learning methods that can achieve these goals.",https://doi.org/10.1177/2470547017747553,
Joint trajectories of depression and perfectionism across adolescence and childhood risk factors,"Abstract The codevelopment of symptoms of depression and socially prescribed perfectionism across adolescence (age 12–17) and non–age-overlapping childhood predictors (age 10–11) of joint trajectory group membership were examined in a sample of 700 Canadian youth. Results indicated that most adolescents (75.8%) followed a trajectory of low depression symptoms (low stable), whereas 15.7% followed an increasing trajectory (increasing), and 8.5% followed a trajectory that began high and decreased over time (high decreasing). More girls than boys were found in the increasing and high decreasing depression trajectories. Adolescents followed three distinct trajectories of socially prescribed perfectionism: 41.6% were in a low stable group, 40.5% in a moderate increasing group, and 17.9% in a high increasing group. Eight percent followed a high-risk dual trajectory of increasing depression and high increasing socially prescribed perfectionism. This joint trajectory was predicted by being bullied, anxious, and relationally aggressive (compared to the low-risk trajectory of low stable depression and perfectionism) at ages 10 and 11. These same predictors, along with poorer family functioning and lower family income, differentiated the joint high decreasing depression/high increasing perfectionism group from the low/low joint group, which comprised of 3.8% of the sample. The developmental progression was best characterized as depression leading to socially prescribed perfectionism. Implications for clinical practice are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579417000979,
Trajectories of Outdoor Mobility in Vulnerable Community-Dwelling Elderly,"Objective: Outdoor mobility is critical for healthy aging, yet little is known about the factors influencing mobility in the frail elderly. We investigated the role of individual and community risk factors on trajectories of mobility in a population of vulnerable community-dwelling elderly. Method: Using data from 1,188 older adults in Detroit, MI, who qualify for federally funded home care, a latent class growth analysis was used to model the frequency of going outside over a 15-month period. Results: Four latent trajectories were found: those with a low, high, and declining frequency of going outdoors over time, and those who do not go outdoors on a regular basis. Risk factors for membership in the homebound and infrequent mobility groups were older age, more severe mobility impairment, and fear of falling. Barriers at the entry to the home were associated with being homebound. Discussion: Declining health status and functional limitations are risk factors that pose a threat to outdoor mobility in the frail elderly, while housing barriers and community accessibility also merit attention.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0898264315611665,
"Narcissism, Bullying, and Social Dominance in Youth: A Longitudinal Analysis","A few previous studies have shown that narcissistic traits in youth are positively associated with bullying. However, research examining the developmental relationship between narcissism and bullying is lacking. Moreover, it is unclear whether narcissists constitute a homogeneous group and whether the bullying of narcissistic youth results in establishing social dominance over peers. The present work addresses these gaps. Children (N = 393; M age = 10.3; 51% girls) were followed during the last 3 years of primary school. Person-centered analyses were used to examine whether groups with distinct developmental trajectories for narcissism and two bullying forms (direct and indirect) can be identified, and how these trajectories are related. Multiple groups emerged for all constructs examined. For girls, higher narcissism was neither related to more intense bullying, nor to higher social dominance. In contrast, highly narcissistic boys were more likely than their peers to show elevated direct bullying, and in particular elevated indirect bullying. Hence, high narcissism is a risk factor for bullying in boys, but not in girls. However, narcissism is not always accompanied by high bullying, given that many boys on the high bullying trajectories were not high in narcissism. Results show that among narcissistic youth only those who engage in high levels of bullying are high in social dominance.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-015-9974-1,
"Trajectories of compliance with COVID-19 related guidelines: longitudinal analyses of 50,000 UK adults","Background: Governments have implemented a range of measure to tackle COVID-19, primarily focusing on changing citizens' behaviours in order to lower transmission of the virus. Some policymakers have expressed concern that citizens would not maintain high levels of compliance with these behaviours over the pandemic and would instead exhibit so-called ""behavioural fatigue"". While the concept has been criticized, there have been few tests of behavioural fatigue using data from the COVID-19 pandemic, and none that have tracked individuals' compliance trajectories. Methods: We used longitudinal data on self-reported compliance from 50,851 adults in the COVID-19 Social Study collected across two waves of the pandemic in the UK (01 April 2020 - 22 February 2021). We modelled typical compliance trajectories using latent growth curve analysis (LGCA) and tested for behavioural fatigue by attempting to identify a set of participants whose compliance decreased substantially over the study period. Results: We selected a four-class LGCA solution. Most individuals maintained high levels of compliance over the pandemic and reported similar levels of compliance across the first and second waves. Approximately one in seven participants had decreasing levels of compliance across the pandemic, reporting noticeably lower levels of compliance in the second wave, a pattern compatible with behavioural fatigue. Individuals with declining compliance levels differed from those with consistently high compliance on multiple characteristics, including (young) age, better physical health, lower empathy and conscientiousness and greater general willingness to take risks. Conclusion: While a minority, not all individuals have maintained high compliance across the pandemic. Decreasing compliance is related to several psychological traits. The results suggest that targeting of behaviour change messages later in the pandemic may be needed to increase compliance.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.04.13.21255336,
"A Multicomponent Early Intervention Program and Trajectories of Behavior, Cognition, and Health","To investigate the developmental impact of a prenatal-to-age-5 multicomponent early intervention program targeting families living in low socioeconomic conditions.Pregnant women from a disadvantaged Irish community were randomly assigned into a treatment group (home visits, baby massage, and parenting program; n = 115) or control group (n = 118). Children's behavioral problems (externalizing, internalizing), cognitive skills (general, vocabulary), and health service use (number of health clinic visits), were regularly assessed (6 months to 4 years of age). Children's developmental trajectories were modeled by using latent class growth analyses to test whether certain subgroups benefited more than others.High and low developmental trajectories were identified for each outcome. Treated children were more likely to follow the high-level trajectory for cognition (odds ratio = 2.89; 95% confidence interval = 1.55-5.50) and vocabulary skills (odds ratio = 2.02; 95% confidence interval = 1.08-3.82). There were no differences by treatment condition in the risk of belonging to a high externalizing or high health clinic visit trajectory. However, within the high externalizing trajectory, treated children had lower scores than controls (Hedges' g range (2-4 years) = 0.45-0.58; P < .05) and, within the high health clinic visit trajectory, only children in the control group experienced an increasing number of visits.This program revealed moderate positive impacts on trajectories of cognitive development and number of health clinic visits for all children, whereas positive impacts on externalizing behavior problems were restricted to children with the most severe problems.",https://doi.org/10.1542/peds.2017-3174,
"Child, Family, and Community Protective Factors in the Development of Children's Early Conduct Problems","The present study utilized a resilience model to investigate child, family, and community protective factors in toddlerhood as they relate to low levels of conduct problems at age 5 in a sample of low income children at risk for early disruptive problem behavior. Child, family, and community factors were associated with lower levels of conduct problems at age 5. Child, family, and community protective factors also distinguished between children who remained below and above a clinical threshold for aggressive problems between age 2 and 5. Finally, each domain of protective factors made small but significant unique contributions to lower aggression at age 5. These results emphasize the importance of multivariate analysis of the ecology of development predicting child outcome, and suggest potential areas for intervention with children at high risk for conduct problems.",https://doi.org/10.1111/fare.12105,
Psychosocial Group Intervention Among War‐Affected Children: An Analysis of Changes in Posttraumatic Cognitions,"Abstract Cognitive theories point to reduction in dysfunctional posttraumatic cognitions (PTCs) as one mechanism involved in recovery from posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS), yet research findings have shown individual differences in the recovery process. We tested the cognitive mediation hypothesis above in a previously published psychosocial group intervention among war‐affected children. We also examined heterogeneity in children's PTCs during the intervention. We used a cluster randomized trial of Smith et al.'s (2002) teaching recovery techniques (TRT) intervention among 482 Palestinians 10–13 years of age ( n = 242 for intervention group, n = 240 for control group). Children reported PTSS, PTCs, and depressive symptoms at baseline, midpoint, postintervention, and at 6‐month follow‐up. Path analysis results showed that TRT was not effective in reducing dysfunctional PTCs, and the reductions did not mediate intervention effects on PTSS. Using latent class growth analysis, we chose the model with 3 differing trajectories in the intervention group: high, decreasing, moderate, downward trending, and severe, stable levels of PTCs. Higher PTSS and depressive symptoms at baseline were associated with membership in the severe, stable trajectory. The intervention did not produce the kind of beneficial cognitive change needed in the cognitive mediation conceptualization. Nevertheless, cognitive changes differed substantially across children during the intervention, and were associated with their preintervention mental health status. These findings call for more detailed examination of the process of cognitive mediation.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22149,
The impact of covariance misspecification in group-based trajectory models for longitudinal data with non-stationary covariance structure,"One purpose of a longitudinal study is to gain a better understanding of how an outcome of interest changes among a given population over time. In what follows, a trajectory will be taken to mean the series of measurements of the outcome variable for an individual. Group-based trajectory modelling methods seek to identify subgroups of trajectories within a population, such that trajectories that are grouped together are more similar to each other than to trajectories in distinct groups. Group-based trajectory models generally assume a certain structure in the covariances between measurements, for example conditional independence, homogeneous variance between groups or stationary variance over time. Violations of these assumptions could be expected to result in poor model performance. We used simulation to investigate the effect of covariance misspecification on misclassification of trajectories in commonly used models under a range of scenarios. To do this we defined a measure of performance relative to the ideal Bayesian correct classification rate. We found that the more complex models generally performed better over a range of scenarios. In particular, incorrectly specified covariance matrices could significantly bias the results but using models with a correct but more complicated than necessary covariance matrix incurred little cost.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280215598806,
Novice drivers’ individual trajectories of driver behavior over the first three years of driving,"Identifying the changes in driving behavior that underlie the decrease in crash risk over the first few months of driving is key to efforts to reduce injury and fatality risk in novice drivers. This study represented a secondary data analysis of 1148 drivers who participated in the UK Cohort II study. The Driver Behavior Questionnaire was completed at 6 months and 1, 2 and 3 years after licensure. Linear latent growth models indicated significant increases across development in all four dimensions of aberrant driving behavior under scrutiny: aggressive violations, ordinary violations, errors and slips. Unconditional and conditional latent growth class analyses showed that the observed heterogeneity in individual trajectories was explained by the presence of multiple homogeneous groups of drivers, each exhibiting specific trajectories of aberrant driver behavior. Initial levels of aberrant driver behavior were important in identifying sub-groups of drivers. All classes showed positive slopes; there was no evidence of a group of drivers whose aberrant behavior decreased over time that might explain the decrease in crash involvement observed over this period. Male gender and younger age predicted membership of trajectories with higher levels of aberrant behavior. These findings highlight the importance of early intervention for improving road safety. We discuss the implications of our findings for understanding the behavioral underpinnings of the decrease in crash involvement observed in the early months of driving.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.aap.2015.05.012,
Toward a Criminology of Terrorism,"The study of terrorism represents one of the major turning points in criminology of the twenty-first century. In the space of just two decades, research on terrorism and political extremism went from a relatively uncommon niche to a widely recognized criminological specialization. Terrorism research now appears in nearly all mainstream criminology journals; college courses on terrorism and political violence have been added to the curricula of most criminology departments; and a growing number of criminology students are choosing terrorism as a suitable topic for class papers, research topics, theses and dissertations. The purpose of this book is to explore similarities and differences between terrorism and more ordinary forms of crime. This Element considers the ways that criminology has contributed to the study of terrorism and the impact the increasing interest in terrorism has had on criminology. This Element also provides empirical comparisons of terrorist attacks to more ordinary crimes and criminal offenders.

Mind the gap: A review and recommendations for statistically evaluating Dual Systems models of adolescent risk behavior,"According to Dual Systems models (Casey et al., 2008; Luna and Wright, 2016; Steinberg, 2008), a rapidly-developing socioemotional system and gradually-developing cognitive control system characterize adolescent brain development. The imbalance hypothesis forwarded by Dual Systems models posits that the magnitude of the imbalance between these two developing systems should predict the propensity for engaging in a variety of risk behaviors. The current integrative review argues that the excitement generated by the imbalance hypothesis and its implications for explaining adolescent risk behaviors has not been meet with equal efforts to rigorously test this hypothesis. The goal of the current review is to help guide the field to consider appropriate and rigorous methods of testing the imbalance hypothesis. First, we review the analytic approaches that have been used to test the imbalance hypothesis and outline statistical and conceptual limitations of these approaches. Next, we discuss the utility of two longitudinal analytic approaches (Latent Difference Scores and Growth Mixture Modeling) for testing the imbalance hypothesis. We utilize data from a large community adolescent sample to illustrate each approach and argue that Latent Difference Scores and Growth Mixture Modeling approaches enhance the specificity and precision with which the imbalance hypothesis is evaluated.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.dcn.2019.100681,
Delinquenz im Altersverlauf,"Zusammenfassung In der kriminologischen Verlaufsforschung werden die Kontinuität und der Abbruch delinquenten Verhaltens im Altersverlauf analysiert. Dazu müssen wiederholt dieselben Personen befragt werden. Neben der Entwicklungsdynamik ermöglichen solche Paneldaten, sowohl kausale Annahmen als auch die Wirkungen von Kontrollinterventionen zu untersuchen. Seit den 1930er Jahren haben sich zunächst eher persönlichkeitsorientierte multifaktorielle und später soziologische Forschungsperspektiven herausgebildet. Im Rahmen Letzterer konnten in jüngerer Zeit auch die Wirkungen polizeilicher und justizieller Kontrollen genauer untersucht werden. In einer Verlaufsperspektive sind weniger sich spontanbewährende gelegentliche Täter von Interesse, als vielmehr wiederholt auffällige (Gewalt-)Täter. Solche Intensivtäter sind ganz überwiegend nicht bis ins höhere Erwachsenenalter, sondern vor allem im Jugend- und Heranwachsendenalter aktiv. Individuelle und (etwas stärker) soziale Ursachen beeinflussen miteinander die Entstehung und den Abbruch delinquenter Verläufe. Formelle Kontrollinterventionen fördern delinquente Normorientierungen sowie die Bindung an delinquente Gruppen und reduzieren schulische oder berufliche Erfolgschancen. In deren Folge kommt es verstärkt zu delinquentem Verhalten.",https://doi.org/10.1515/mks-2019-0004,
Are Changes in Personality Traits and Alcohol Use Associated? A Cohort Study Among Young Swiss Men,"Objective: It is well known that certain personality traits are associated with alcohol use. Because less is known about it, we wished to investigate whether changes in alcohol use were longitudinally associated with changes in personality and in which direction the influence or causation might flow. Methods: Data came from the self-reported questionnaire answers of 5,125 young men at two time points during the Cohort study on Substance Use Risk Factors (C-SURF). Their average ages were 20.0 and 25.4 years old at the first and second wave assessments, respectively. Four personality traits were measured: (a) aggression–hostility; (b) sociability; (c) neuroticism–anxiety; and (d) sensation seeking. Alcohol use was measured by volume (drinks per week) and binge drinking (about 60+ grams per occasion). Cross-lagged panel models and two-wave latent change score models were used. Results: Aggression–hostility, sensation seeking, and sociability were significantly and positively cross-sectionally associated with both alcohol use variables. Drinking volume and these three personality traits bidirectionally predicted each other. Binge drinking was bidirectionally associated with sensation-seeking only, whereas aggression–hostility and sociability only predicted binge drinking, but not vice versa . Changes in alcohol use were significantly positively associated with changes in aggression–hostility, sensation seeking, and sociability. Associations reached small Cohen's effect sizes for sociability and sensation seeking, but not for aggression–hostility. Associations with neuroticism–anxiety were mostly not significant. Conclusion: The direction of effects confirmed findings from other studies, and the association between changes in personality and alcohol use support the idea that prevention programs should simultaneously target both.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.591003,
Changes in Depression and Positive Mental Health Among Youth in a Healthy Relationships Program,"Mental health promotion programming in schools and community settings is an important part of a comprehensive mental health strategy. The goal of this study was to identify and explore meaningful classes of youth based on their pre- and post-intervention depression symptoms scores with 722 youth involved in a 15-week healthy relationships and mental health promotion program. We utilized latent class growth analysis to identify depression class trajectories, controlling for group clustering effects. A three-class solution identified high decreasing, moderate stable, and low stable trajectories. Gender, age, and reported experience of bullying victimization predicted trajectory class membership. The low stable class trajectory was associated with the highest positive mental health, followed by the moderate stable and the high decreasing trajectories. These results suggest that youth with the highest depression scores showed significant improvement in symptomatology over the course of the program.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0829573518777154,
Describing Trajectories of Homeless Service Use in Hawai‘i Using Latent Class Growth Analysis,"The State of Hawai'i, like many other areas across the United States, has large numbers of individuals and families experiencing homelessness, many of whom seek support through statewide shelters and services. This study explored the diversity of ways in which individuals and families moved through Hawai'i's homeless service system. Using administrative data, a cohort of new service users was tracked across time to trace the developmental trajectories of their homeless service use. The sample consisted of adults who had entered the service system for the first time in the fiscal year (FY) of 2010 (N = 4655). These individuals were then tracked through the end of FY 2014, as they used emergency shelter, transitional shelter, and outreach services. A latent class growth analysis was conducted and identified four distinct patterns of service use: low service use (n = 3966, 85.2%); typical transitional shelter use (n = 452, 9.7%); atypical transitional use (n = 127, 2.7%), and potential chronic service use (n = 110, 2.4%). Multinomial logistic regression models were then used to determine if select demographic, family, background experience (e.g., education, employment), or health variables were associated with class membership. The distinct profiles for class membership are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ajcp.12128,
Conduct Problem Trajectories Between Age 4 and 17 and Their Association with Behavioral Adjustment in Emerging Adulthood,"Individual heterogeneity exists in the onset and development of conduct problems, but theoretical claims about predictors and prognosis are often not consistent with the empirical findings. This study examined shape and outcomes of conduct problem trajectories in a Belgian population-based sample (N = 682; 49.5 % boys). Mothers reported on children's conduct problems across six waves (age 4–17) and emerging adults reported on their behavioral adjustment (age 17–20). Applying mixture modeling, we found four gender-invariant trajectories (labeled life-course-persistent, adolescence-onset, childhood-limited, and low). The life-course-persistent group was least favorably adjusted, but the adolescence-onset group was similarly maladjusted in externalizing problems and may be less normative (15 % of the sample) than previously believed. The childhood-limited group was at heightened risk for specifically internalizing problems, being more worrisome than its label suggests. Interventions should not only be aimed at early detection of conduct problems, but also at adolescents to avoid future maladjustment.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10964-016-0476-4,
Child personality facets and overreactive parenting as predictors of aggression and rule-breaking trajectories from childhood to adolescence,"This study examined trajectories of aggression and rule breaking during the transition from childhood to adolescence (ages 9-15), and determined whether these trajectories were predicted by lower order personality facets, overreactive parenting, and their interaction. At three time points separated by 2-year intervals, mothers and fathers reported on their children's aggression and rule breaking (N = 290, M age = 8.8 years at Time 1). At Time 1, parents reported on their children's personality traits and their own overreactivity. Growth mixture modeling identified three aggression trajectories (low decreasing, high decreasing, and high increasing) and two rule-breaking trajectories (low and high). Lower optimism and compliance and higher energy predicted trajectories for both aggression and rule breaking, whereas higher expressiveness and irritability and lower orderliness and perseverance were unique risk factors for increasing aggression into adolescence. Lower concentration was a unique risk factor for increasing rule breaking. Parental overreactivity predicted higher trajectories of aggression but not rule breaking. Only two Trait × Overreactivity interactions were found. Our results indicate that personality facets could differentiate children at risk for different developmental trajectories of aggression and rule breaking.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579415000577,
Posttraumatic Stress Trajectories in World Trade Center Tower Survivors: Hyperarousal and Emotional Numbing Predict Symptom Change,"Abstract There is a paucity of knowledge concerning the underlying symptomatology of heterogeneous posttraumatic stress symptom (PTSS) trajectories following mass trauma, such as a terrorist attack. This study examined longitudinal PTSS trajectories using latent growth mixture modeling in 2,355 World Trade Center (WTC) tower survivors surveyed by the WTC Health Registry an average of 2.5, 5.5, and 10.5 years after the September 11, 2001 terrorist attacks. Covariates included sociodemographic characteristics, WTC‐related exposure, and other traumas/stressors. Four curvilinear PTSS trajectories were identified: low symptom (74.9%), recovering (8.0%), worsening (6.7%), and chronic (10.4%). The majority of WTC survivors (85.3%) maintained stable symptom trajectories over time, with PTSS changes occurring less often. Although WTC‐related exposure was associated with initial PTSS severity, exposure was not associated with chronicity or change of PTSS over time. Male gender and a higher number of post‐WTC disaster life‐stressors were associated with worsening symptom severity over time. Individuals with more severe hyperarousal symptoms at Wave 1, particularly of anxious arousal, were more likely to have PTSS that worsened over time, adjusted odds ratio (a OR ) = 1.55. Less severe emotional numbing symptoms, particularly of dysphoria, at Wave 1, were marginally significantly associated with subsequent PTSS recovery, a OR = 0.75. Interventions that target hyperarousal and emotional numbing symptoms may mitigate a worsening of symptoms and facilitate posttraumatic recovery following future mass traumas, such as terrorist attacks. Further clinical implications are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22357,
"Predictors of PTSD Treatment Response Trajectories in a Sample of Childhood Sexual Abuse Survivors: The Roles of Social Support, Coping, and PTSD Symptom Clusters","This study aimed to (a) identify posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) trajectories in a sample of Danish treatment-seeking childhood sexual abuse (CSA) survivors and (b) examine the roles of social support, coping style, and individual PTSD symptom clusters (avoidance, reexperiencing, and hyperarousal) as predictors of the identified trajectories. We utilized a convenience sample of 439 CSA survivors attending personalized psychotherapy treatment in Denmark. Four assessments were conducted on a six monthly basis over a period of 18 months. We used latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to test solutions with one to six classes. Following this, a logistic regression was conducted to examine predictors of the identified trajectories. Results revealed four distinct trajectories which were labeled high PTSD gradual response, high PTSD treatment resistant, moderate PTSD rapid response, and moderate PTSD gradual response. Emotional and detached coping and more severe pretreatment avoidance and reexperiencing symptoms were associated with more severe and treatment resistant PTSD. High social support and a longer length of time since the abuse were associated with less severe PTSD which improved over time. The findings suggested that treatment response of PTSD in CSA survivors is characterized by distinct patterns with varying levels and rates of PTSD symptom improvement. Results revealed that social support is protective and that emotional and detached coping and high pretreatment levels of avoidance and reexperiencing symptoms are risk factors in relation to PTSD severity and course. These factors could potentially identify patients who are at risk of not responding to treatment. Furthermore, these factors could be specifically addressed to increase positive outcomes for treatment-seeking CSA survivors.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260517741212,
Parental trajectories of PTSD and child adjustment: Findings from the Building a New Life in Australia study.,"Evidence suggests that the psychosocial adjustment of children of refugees may be compromised when a parent has symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD). We sought to determine whether trajectories of parental PTSD symptoms might relate to child adjustment and whether there is an additive effect when both parents, as opposed to just one, has prominent PTSD symptoms. We report data from the first three years of a prospective study of recent Australian humanitarian migrants: the Building a New Life in Australia study. Parental PTSD symptoms were assessed on three occasions, and latent class growth analysis was used to identify homogenous groups of parents based on their PTSD symptoms. The Strength and Difficulties Questionnaire was administered to assess child psychosocial adjustment. Regression analyses were then conducted to determine whether trajectories of parental PTSD symptoms predicted child adjustment. After controlling for child age and gender, the presence of either one or both parents with persistently high PTSD symptoms was associated with children's having greater emotional difficulties and poorer overall psychosocial adjustment. Children with both parents with persistently high PTSD had higher levels of emotional difficulties than did children with a single parent with high PTSD symptoms. For emotional difficulties, though not other domains of child psychosocial adjustment, there indeed appears to be an additive impact of having two parents, rather than just one, with persistently high PTSD symptoms, although the magnitude of these effects was small. The clinical and service provision implications of these findings are discussed. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2020 APA, all rights reserved).",https://doi.org/10.1037/ort0000434,
Co‐Occurring Trajectory of Mothers’ Substance Use and Psychological Control and Children's Behavior Problems: The Effects of a Family Systems Intervention,"This study examined the effects of a family systems therapy (Ecologically‐Based Family Therapy [ EBFT ]) on the co‐occurring trajectory of mothers’ substance use and psychological control, and its association with children's problem behaviors. Participants included 183 mothers with a substance use disorder who had at least one biological child in their care. Mothers were randomly assigned to one of the three intervention conditions: EBFT —home, n = 62; EBFT —office, n = 61; or Women's Health Education, n = 60. Participants were assessed at baseline, 3, 6, 12, and 18 months post‐baseline. A dual‐trajectory class growth analysis identified three groups of mothers in regard to their change trajectories. The majority of the mothers exhibited a synchronous decrease in substance use and psychological control ( n = 107). In all, 46 mothers exhibited a synchronous increase in substance use and psychological control. For the remaining 30 mothers, substance use and psychological control remained stable. Mothers in the family therapy condition were more likely to show reduced substance use and psychological control compared to mothers in the control condition. Moreover, children with mothers who showed decreased substance use and psychological control exhibited lower levels of problem behaviors compared to children with mothers showing increased substance use and psychological control. The findings provide evidence for the effectiveness of family systems therapy, EBFT , in treating mothers’ substance use, improving parenting behaviors, and subsequently improving child behavioral outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12279,
Religious Development in African American Adolescents: Growth Patterns That Offer Protection,"Although religiosity promotes resilient outcomes in African American ( AA ) adolescents, there is a lack of research that examines the protective role of religious development in the context of stressful life events ( SLE s). In 1,595 AA adolescents, a cohort‐sequential design was used from ages 12 to 18 to examine subtypes of religiosity, as well as distinct developmental patterns within subtypes. The protective role of religious development was also examined in the context of SLE s. The study findings indicated two subtypes of religiosity—extrinsic and intrinsic religiosity—as well as low and high developmental patterns in the identified subtypes. Furthermore, the protective influence of extrinsic and intrinsic religiosity gradually diminished from age 12 to 18 in the context of SLE s.",https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12896,
"Child Maltreatment, Delinquent Behavior, and School Factors as Predictors of Depressive Symptoms from Adolescence to Adulthood: A Growth Mixture Model","Previous methodological approaches have not been flexible enough to model the heterogeneity of depressive symptoms or to identify variations between prototypical trajectories conditional on risk and protective factors. The current study examined latent class trajectories of depressive symptoms using data from 3,819 respondents of the Adolescent Health Survey. Four trajectory profiles of depressive symptoms were identified: low-stable, high-decreasing, low-increasing, and moderate-decreasing. A broad array of risk factors were included into the modeling procedure to identify predictors of group membership. Relative to the low-stable group, membership in one of the three symptomatic groups (i.e., heightened depressive symptoms) was predicted by poverty, low self-esteem, gender, drinking frequency, poor academic outcomes, delinquency, and child maltreatment type. This study contributes to our understanding about the longitudinal manifestations of depression and identifies a broad array of factors significantly related to pathways of resilience.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0044118x17721803,
Hypothalamic pituitary adrenal activity and autonomic nervous system arousal predict developmental trajectories of children's comorbid behavior problems,"ABSTRACT The combined effects of hypothalamic‐pituitary‐adrenal (HPA) axis activity and autonomic nervous system (ANS) arousal were examined on developmental trajectories of children's comorbid internalizing and externalizing problems. Participants were 394 urban dwelling, primarily African American, youth (50% male, age 11–12 years). Parent‐reported child behavior problems were obtained initially, 3, 6, and 12 months later. Saliva samples (collected at the initial assessment) were assayed for cortisol (HPA) and alpha‐amylase (ANS). Cross‐domain latent class growth analysis identified a stable comorbid trajectory and four other distinct short‐term developmental trajectories of internalizing and externalizing behavior problems. ANS arousal was negatively associated with the probability of stable comorbidity, but only among youth who also had high levels of HPA axis activity. Findings underscore the predictive value of the interaction of HPA axis activity and ANS arousal in differentiating children with stable comorbidity and have important implications for etiological theories and treatment outcome research. © 2015 Wiley Periodicals, Inc .

Trajectories of Academic Achievement in High Schools: Growth Mixture Model,"The current study investigated patterns of growth in academic achievement trajectories among American high school students (N = 12,314) that were obtained from a nationally representative, public-use dataset (the High School Longitudinal Study of 2009) in relation to key demographic information (i.e., gender, grade level, socioeconomic status [SES] in ninth grade, and ethnicity) and a distal outcome (i.e., applying for college). Unconditional growth mixture model showed that the three-class model was most appropriate in capturing the latent heterogeneity (i.e., low-achieving/increasing, moderate-achieving/decreasing, and high-achieving/slightly increasing). Two covariates (i.e., gender and SES in ninth grade) were positively associated with the intercept growth factor (i.e., initial GPA) in two of the three achievement classes (i.e., high-achieving and moderate-achieving). In contrast, two other covariates (i.e., Hispanic and African American) were negatively associated with the intercept growth factor in all of the achievement classes. The multinomial logistic regression coefficients identified an increase in the likelihood of belonging to the following achievement classes: (1) Moderate-achieving, if the students were male or African American and of low SES, (2) Low-achieving, if the students were male and of low SES, and (3) High-achieving, if the students were female and of an ethnicity other than African American and high SES. The probability of not applying for college was higher among the low-achieving and the moderate-achieving classes compared with the high-achieving class (223 words).",https://doi.org/10.5296/jei.v6i1.16775,
Trajectories of screen time across adolescence and their associations with adulthood mental health and behavioural outcomes,"Excessive screen time among adolescents is discussed as a significant public health concern. Identifying adolescent longitudinal patterns of time spent on regularly-used media screens and understanding their adulthood mental health and behavioural issue correlates can help inform interventions for these later-life outcomes. This study aimed to characterize joint developmental patterns of time spent with videogames, surfing/chatting the Internet, and TV/DVDs during adolescence (at ages 11,13,15,17) and their associations with mental health (i.e., depression, anxiety, ADHD symptoms, suicidal ideation, and self-injury) and behavioural issues (i.e., substance use, delinquency, aggression) in adulthood (at age 20). A parallel-process latent class growth analysis was used to model data from a diverse community-ascertained sample of youth in Zurich, Switzerland (n=1521; 51.7% males). Results showed that a five-class model best fitted the data: (1) low-screen use, 37.6%; (2) increasing chatting/surfing, 24.0%; (3) moderate-screen use, 18.6%; (4) early-adolescence videogame use, 9.9%; and (5) increasing videogame and chatting/surfing, 9.9%. The trajectory groups differed in their adulthood outcomes of mental health and behavioural problems, indicating the importance of problematic screen usage patterns in predicting these outcomes. These findings suggest screen time reduction interventions aimed at improving these problems should be tailored to the members of specific trajectory groups.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/8dh6c,
The Stability of Problem Behavior Across the Preschool Years: An Empirical Approach in the General Population,"This study examined the stability of internalizing and externalizing problems from age 1.5 to 6 years, while taking into account developmental changes in the presentation of problems. The study comprised a population-based cohort of 7,206 children (50.4 % boys). At ages 1.5, 3, and 6 years, mothers reported on problem behavior using the Child Behavior Checklist/1.5-5 (CBCL/1.5-5). At each age we performed latent profile analysis on the CBCL/1.5-5 scales. Latent transition analysis (LTA) was applied to study the stability of problem behavior. Profiles of problem behavior varied across ages. At each age, 82–87 % of the children did not have problems whereas approximately 2 % showed a profile of co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems. This profile was more severe (with higher scores) at 6 years than at earlier ages. A predominantly internalizing profile only emerged at 6 years, while a profile with externalizing problems and emotional reactivity was present at each age. LTA showed that, based on profiles at 1.5 and 3 years, it was difficult to predict the type of profile at 6 years. Children with a profile of co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems early in life were most likely to show problem behavior at 6 years. This study shows that the presentation of problem behavior changes across the preschool period and that heterotypic continuity of problems is very common among preschoolers. Children with co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problems were most likely to show persisting problems. The use of evidence-based treatment for these young children may prevent psychiatric problems across the life course.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10802-015-9993-y,
Developmental pathways of physical aggression from infancy to early school age,"Abstract This study identified latent trajectories of physical aggression from infancy to preschool age and tested for (a) early parent, parenting and child predictor effects on trajectory membership and (b) trajectory-effects net of parent, parenting, and child predictor effects on Grade 2 social, behavioral and academic functioning. We used data from the Behavior Outlook Norwegian Developmental Study (BONDS), comprising 1,159 children (559 girls). Parents reported on risk and protective factors, and on physical aggression from 1 to 5 years; teachers reported on Grade 2 outcomes. We employed latent class growth curve analyses to identify nine aggression trajectories. In fully adjusted models testing simultaneously all associations among predictors, trajectories, and outcomes, maternal and paternal harsh parenting, child gender, and sibling presence predicted trajectory membership, which significantly predicted Grade 2 externalizing. Child gender had a pervasive influence on all outcomes as well as on trajectory membership. This is the first trajectory study that attempts to sort out which predictors are most proximal, more distal, or just confounded, with their relative direct effect sizes, and to link early paternal as well as maternal harsh parenting with children’s development of physical aggression from infancy to preschool age. Our findings underscore the need to include fathers in developmental research and early prevention and intervention efforts.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.09.06.23295119,
<scp>Within‐family</scp> linkages between parental monitoring and adolescents externalizing problems with autonomy support as a moderator,"Parents' monitoring efforts are thought to be effective in reducing children's future externalizing problems. Empirical evidence for this claim, however, is limited, as only few studies have unraveled the temporal ordering of these constructs. The present six-wave longitudinal study contributed to the existing literature by examining within-family linkages between monitoring efforts (behavioral control and solicitation) and adolescents' externalizing behaviors while controlling for between-family differences. In addition, it was assessed whether these associations differed when using child versus parent reports, differed for less versus more autonomy-supportive parents, and differed for fathers' versus mothers' monitoring efforts. Longitudinal data (six annual waves) of 497 adolescents (56.9% boys, Mage at T1 = 13.03, SD = 0.46), their mothers (N = 495, Mage at T1 = 44.41, SD = 4.45), and their fathers (N = 446, Mage at T1 = 46.74, SD = 5.10) of the Dutch study Research on Adolescent Development and Relationships (RADAR) were used. Results showed no evidence for the claim that parents' monitoring efforts predict future externalizing problems. In contrast, we found some evidence for the idea that parents' monitoring efforts change in reaction to changes in externalizing problems; when adolescents reported higher levels of externalizing problems than usual in 1 year, this predicted less behavioral control from mothers in the next year. Linkages between monitoring efforts and externalizing problems did not differ between less or more autonomy-supportive parents. Overall, our findings suggest that monitoring efforts are not effective, but also not damaging, in relation to adolescents' externalizing problems.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jora.12868,
"Sociodemographic factors associated with trajectories of depression among urban refugee youth in Kampala, Uganda: A longitudinal cohort study","Abstract Background There is a high prevalence of depression among refugee youth in low- and middle-income countries, yet depression trajectories are understudied. This study examined depression trajectories, and factors associated with trajectories, among urban refugee youth in Kampala, Uganda. Methods We conducted a longitudinal cohort study with refugee youth aged 16–24 in Kampala, Uganda. We assessed depression using the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 and conducted latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to identify depression trajectories. Sociodemographic and socioecological factors were examined as predictors of trajectory clusters using multivariable logistic regression. Results Data were collected from n = 164 participants (n = 89 cisgender women, n = 73 cisgender men, n = 2 transgender persons; mean age: 19.9, standard deviation: 2.5 at seven timepoints; n = 1,116 observations). Two distinct trajectory clusters were identified: “sustained low depression level” (n = 803, 71.9%) and “sustained high depression level” (n = 313, 28.1%). Sociodemographic (older age, gender [cisgender women vs. cisgender men], longer time in Uganda), and socioecological (structural: unemployment, food insecurity; interpersonal: parenthood, recent intimate partner violence) factors were significantly associated with the sustained high trajectory of depression. Conclusions The chronicity of depression highlights the critical need for early depression screening with urban refugee youth in Kampala. Addressing multilevel depression drivers prompts age and gender-tailored strategies and considering social determinants of health.",https://doi.org/10.1017/gmh.2024.135,
Performance of methods for estimating the effect of covariates on group membership probabilities in group-based trajectory models,"One purpose of a longitudinal study is to gain insight of how characteristics at earlier points in time can impact on subsequent outcomes. Typically, the outcome variable varies over time and the data for each individual can be used to form a discrete path of measurements, that is a trajectory. Group-based trajectory modelling methods seek to identify subgroups of individuals within a population with trajectories that are more similar to each other than to trajectories in distinct groups. An approach to modelling the influence of covariates measured at earlier time points in the group-based setting is to consider models wherein these covariates affect the group membership probabilities. Models in which prior covariates impact the trajectories directly are also possible but are not considered here. In the present study, we compared six different methods for estimating the effect of covariates on the group membership probabilities, which have different approaches to account for the uncertainty in the group membership assignment. We found that when investigating the effect of one or several covariates on a group-based trajectory model, the full likelihood approach minimized the bias in the estimate of the covariate effect. In this ‘1-step’ approach, the estimation of the effect of covariates and the trajectory model are carried out simultaneously. Of the ‘3-step’ approaches, where the effect of the covariates is assessed subsequent to the estimation of the group-based trajectory model, only Vermunt’s improved 3 step resulted in bias estimates similar in size to the full likelihood approach. The remaining methods considered resulted in considerably higher bias in the covariate effect estimates and should not be used. In addition to the bias empirically demonstrated for the probability regression approach, we have shown analytically that it is biased in general.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280216689580,
Mental health across the early years in the military,"The mental health impact of the initial years of military service is an under-researched area. This study is the first to explore mental health trajectories and associated predictors in military members across the first 3-4 years of their career to provide evidence to inform early interventions.This prospective cohort study surveyed Australian Defence personnel (n = 5329) at four time-points across their early military career. Core outcomes were psychological distress (K10+) and posttraumatic stress symptoms [four-item PTSD Checklist (PCL-4)] with intra-individual, organizational and event-related trajectory predictors. Latent class growth analyses (LCGAs) identified subgroups within the sample that followed similar longitudinal trajectories for these outcomes, while conditional LCGAs examined the variables that influenced patterns of mental health.Three clear trajectories emerged for psychological distress: resilient (84.0%), worsening (9.6%) and recovery (6.5%). Four trajectories emerged for post-traumatic stress, including resilient (82.5%), recovery (9.6%), worsening (5.8%) and chronic subthreshold (2.3%) trajectories. Across both outcomes, prior trauma exposure alongside modifiable factors, such as maladaptive coping styles, and increased anger and sleep difficulties were associated with the worsening and chronic subthreshold trajectories, whilst members in the resilient trajectories were more likely to be male, report increased social support from family/friends and Australian Defence Force (ADF) sources, and use adaptive coping styles.The emergence of symptoms of mental health problems occurs early in the military lifecycle for a significant proportion of individuals. Modifiable factors associated with wellbeing identified in this study are ideal targets for intervention, and should be embedded and consolidated throughout the military career.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291722000332,
Multiple health risk behaviors and mental health from a life course perspective: The Dutch TRAILS study,"We examined trajectories of multiple health risk behavior (MHRB) patterns throughout adolescence, and changes in mental health from childhood to young adulthood. Further, we assessed how continuity or onset of MHRBs overall were associated with subsequent changes in mental health, and whether this varied by type of MHRBs. We used six waves of the prospective Dutch TRAILS study (2001-2016; n = 2229), covering ages 11 until 23. We measured MHRBs (substance use: alcohol misuse, cannabis use, smoking; and obesity-related: overweight, physical inactivity, irregular breakfast intake) at three time points during adolescence. We assessed mental health as Youth/Adult Self-report total problems at ages 11 and 23. Latent class growth analyses and ANOVA were used to examine longitudinal trajectories and associations. We identified six developmental trajectories for the total of MHRBs and mental health. Trajectories varied regarding likelihood of MHRBs throughout adolescence, mental health at baseline, and changes in mental health problems in young adulthood. We found no associations for the continuity of overall MHRBs throughout adolescence, and neither for early, mid- or late onset, with changes in mental health problems in young adulthood. However, continuity of MHRBs in the obesity-related subgroup was significantly associated with an increase in mental health problems. Adolescents with the same MHRB patterns may, when reaching adulthood, have different levels of mental health problems, with mental health at age 11 being an important predictor. Further, involvement with obesity-related MHRBs continuously throughout adolescence is associated with increased mental health problems in young adulthood.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ypmed.2021.106870,
How Has Criminology Contributed to the Study of Terrorism since 9/11?,"Purpose Prior to 9/11 criminologists paid relatively little attention to the study of terrorism.

Developmental trajectories of paediatric headache – sex-specific analyses and predictors,"Headache is the most common pain disorder in children and adolescents and is associated with diverse dysfunctions and psychological symptoms. Several studies evidenced sex-specific differences in headache frequency. Until now no study exists that examined sex-specific patterns of change in paediatric headache across time and included pain-related somatic and (socio-)psychological predictors. Latent Class Growth Analysis (LCGA) was used in order to identify different trajectory classes of headache across four annual time points in a population-based sample (n = 3 227; mean age 11.34 years; 51.2 % girls). In multinomial logistic regression analyses the influence of several predictors on the class membership was examined. For girls, a four-class model was identified as the best fitting model. While the majority of girls reported no (30.5 %) or moderate headache frequencies (32.5 %) across time, one class with a high level of headache days (20.8 %) and a class with an increasing headache frequency across time (16.2 %) were identified. For boys a two class model with a 'no headache class' (48.6 %) and 'moderate headache class' (51.4 %) showed the best model fit. Regarding logistic regression analyses, migraine and parental headache proved to be stable predictors across sexes. Depression/anxiety was a significant predictor for all pain classes in girls. Life events, dysfunctional stress coping and school burden were also able to differentiate at least between some classes in both sexes. The identified trajectories reflect sex-specific differences in paediatric headache, as seen in the number and type of classes extracted. The documented risk factors can deliver ideas for preventive actions and considerations for treatment programmes.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s10194-016-0627-8,
Predicting Adolescents’ Bullying Participation from Developmental Trajectories of Social Status and Behavior,The aim of this study was to determine how trajectory clusters of social status (social preference and perceived popularity) and behavior (direct aggression and prosocial behavior) from age 9 to age 14 predicted adolescents’ bullying participant roles at age 16 and 17 ( n = 266). Clusters were identified with multivariate growth mixture modeling (GMM). The findings showed that participants’ developmental trajectories of social status and social behavior across childhood and early adolescence predicted their bullying participant role involvement in adolescence. Practical implications and suggestions for further research are discussed.,https://doi.org/10.1111/cdev.12794,
"A new trajectory approach for investigating the association between an environmental or occupational exposure over lifetime and the risk of chronic disease: Application to smoking, asbestos, and lung cancer","Quantifying the association between lifetime exposures and the risk of developing a chronic disease is a recurrent challenge in epidemiology. Individual exposure trajectories are often heterogeneous and studying their associations with the risk of disease is not straightforward. We propose to use a latent class mixed model (LCMM) to identify profiles (latent classes) of exposure trajectories and estimate their association with the risk of disease. The methodology is applied to study the association between lifetime trajectories of smoking or occupational exposure to asbestos and the risk of lung cancer in males of the ICARE population-based case-control study. Asbestos exposure was assessed using a job exposure matrix. The classes of exposure trajectories were identified using two separate LCMM for smoking and asbestos, and the association between the identified classes and the risk of lung cancer was estimated in a second stage using weighted logistic regression and all subjects. A total of 2026/2610 cases/controls had complete information on both smoking and asbestos exposure, including 1938/1837 cases/controls ever smokers, and 1417/1520 cases/controls ever exposed to asbestos. The LCMM identified four latent classes of smoking trajectories which had different risks of lung cancer, all much stronger than never smokers. The most frequent class had moderate constant intensity over lifetime while the three others had either long-term, distant or recent high intensity. The latter had the strongest risk of lung cancer. We identified five classes of asbestos exposure trajectories which all had higher risk of lung cancer compared to men never occupationally exposed to asbestos, whatever the dose and the timing of exposure. The proposed approach opens new perspectives for the analyses of dose-time-response relationships between protracted exposures and the risk of developing a chronic disease, by providing a complete picture of exposure history in terms of intensity, duration, and timing of exposure.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0236736,
Patterns of Violence Victimization and Perpetration Among Adolescents Using Latent Class Analysis,"Research has identified interpersonal violence (a broad term that includes stalking, harassment, sexual assault, and physical dating violence) as a major problem among adolescents. Research suggests that there are different patterns, or classes, of interpersonal violence victimization and perpetration, but little of this work has focused on adolescents. In the current study, we conducted latent class analysis using a sample of 2,921 adolescent girls and boys in high school from northern New England to assess varying patterns of interpersonal violence victimization and perpetration over the past 2 months, specifically stalking, harassment, sexual assault, and dating violence. Four classes of violence victimization and perpetration were identified: (a) No Victimization or Perpetration class (n = 1,898, 65.0%), (b) Low Victimization and Perpetration class (n = 343, 11.7%), (c) Harassment Victimization Only class (n = 560, 19.2%), and (d) High Victimization and Low Perpetration class (n = 120, 4.1%). Several differences in classes emerged as a function of demographic and behavioral health variables. For example, the High Victimization and Low Perpetration class had the highest proportion of girls and youth with sexual minority status. Furthermore, youth in the High Victimization and Low Perpetration class also had a significantly higher proportion of class members endorsing depressed mood and engagement in binge drinking than the youth in other classes. These findings demonstrate the heterogeneity in patterns of interpersonal violence, which future research should seek to better understand in terms of etiology, outcomes, and best practices for prevention and intervention.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0886260519862272,
Trajectories of Health and Behavioral Health Services Use among Community Corrections–Involved Rural Adults,"This article seeks to establish time-based trajectories of health and behavioral health services utilization for community corrections-involved (CCI) adults and to examine demographic and clinical correlates associated with these trajectories. To accomplish this aim, the authors applied a latent class growth analysis (LCGA) to services use data from a sample of rural CCI adults who reported their medical, mental health, and substance use treatment utilization behavior every 60 days for 1.5 years. LCGA established 1.5-year trajectories and demographic correlates of health services among rural CCI adults. For medical services, three classes emerged (stable-low users, 13%; stable-intermediate users, 40%; and stable-high users, 47%). For mental health and substance use services, three classes emerged (stable-low, 69% and 61%, respectively; low-baseline-increase, 10% and 12%, respectively; high-baseline decline, 21% and 28%, respectively). Employment, gender, medication usage, and depression severity predicted membership across all services. Results underscore the importance of social workers and other community services providers aligning health services access with the needs of the CCI population, and highlight CCI adults as being at risk of underservice in critical prevention and intervention domains.",https://doi.org/10.1093/swr/svv048,
Resilience to adversity and the early origins of disease,"Abstract For the past quarter century, scientists at the Center for Family Research at the University of Georgia have conducted research designed to promote understanding of normative developmental trajectories among low socioeconomic status African American children, youths, and young adults. In this paper, we describe a recent expansion of this research program using longitudinal, epidemiological studies and randomized prevention trials to test hypotheses about the origins of disease among rural African American youths. The contributions of economic hardship, downward mobility, neighborhood poverty, and racial discrimination to allostatic load and epigenetic aging are illustrated. The health benefits of supportive family relationships in protecting youths from these challenges are also illustrated. A cautionary set of studies is presented showing that some psychosocially resilient youths demonstrate high allostatic loads and accelerated epigenetic aging, suggesting that, for some, “resilience is just skin deep.” Finally, we end on an optimistic note by demonstrating that family-centered prevention programs can have health benefits by reducing inflammation, helping to preserve telomere length, and inhibiting epigenetic aging.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579416000894,
Taking stock of life-course criminology,"This introduction presents an overview of the key concepts discussed in the subsequent chapters of this book. The book covers the latest developments in life-course criminological theory. It reviews two popular life-course theories—Sampson and Laub's age-graded theory, and Giordano and colleagues' cognitive transformation theory—focusing on the role of human agency in these theories. Challenged by the longitudinal perspective of the life-course approach, the book examines how both continuity and change can be understood from the perspective of the Situational Action Theory. The book investigates important aspects of criminal careers, and focuses on the development of delinquency and crime in adolescence and early adulthood. It draws from in-depth interviews with a subsample of young adults in the Pathways to Desistance Study, a prospective longitudinal study of desistance from crime among serious adolescent offenders from Phoenix, Arizona, and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The book summarizes the key findings of the Individual Development and Adaption (IDA) study.",https://doi.org/10.4324/9781315747996-1,
Trajectories of participation in organized activities and outcomes in young adulthood,"To examine whether trajectories of participation in organized activities during the high school years and beyond (from ages 14 to 20) predicted outcomes at age 21 (externalizing problems, internalizing problems, civic engagement, number of years of education, and perception of physical health), 354 youths (60% girls) were surveyed annually over nine years. Four trajectories were found: (a) ""Low and decreasing"" (71%), (b) ""Moderate and stable"" (12%), (c) ""High and decreasing after high school"" (12%), and (d) ""High and increasing after high school"" (5%). Results revealed that the predicted outcomes varied according to the different trajectories. Pursuing high levels of activity participation beyond high school was especially beneficial with respect to externalizing problems and educational attainment.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10888691.2017.1308829,
Time course of symptoms in posttraumatic stress disorder with delayed expression: A systematic review,"Abstract Objective To examine the hypothesis that PTSD with delayed expression in some cases occurs without subthreshold PTSD symptoms above background levels bridging the gap between the traumatic exposure(s) and the clinical diagnosis. Methods We performed systematic searches of peer‐reviewed papers in English referenced in Pubmed, Embase, or PsycINFO and ascertained 34 prospective studies of PTSD symptom trajectories identified by latent class growth statistical modeling. Studies with delayed and low‐stable trajectories provided appropriate data for this study. We computed the difference between the delayed trajectory PTSD symptom sumscore and the low‐stable PTSD sumscore at the observed points in time after the traumatic event(s). Results In 29 study populations, the latent class growth analyses displayed delayed trajectories, and in these, we identified 110 data points (% PTSD sumscore difference/months since traumatic exposure). The median PTSD symptom sumscore was 25% higher during the initial 6 months among individuals in the delayed trajectory compared to those in low‐stable trajectory. From this level, the difference widened and reached a plateau of 40–50% higher. The variation was large, and the baseline participation rate and loss to follow‐up were exceeding 25% in the majority of the studies. Heterogeneity of populations, measures, and analyses precluded formal meta‐analysis. Conclusion Delayed PTSD is preceded by PTSD symptoms during the first year in most cases. Still, few individuals may experience an asymptomatic delay. The results underpin the rationale for monitoring PTSD symptoms and may inform forensic assessments in that delayed PTSD without symptoms bridging the traumatic event is rare.",https://doi.org/10.1111/acps.13372,
Influences of victimization and comorbid conditions on substance use disorder outcomes in justice-involved youth: A discrete time survival mixture analysis,"Abstract To understand how exposure to victimization during adolescence and the presence of comorbid psychological conditions influence substance use treatment entry and substance use disorder diagnosis from 14 to 25 years old among serious juvenile offenders, this study included 1,354 serious juvenile offenders who were prospectively followed over 7 years. Growth mixture modeling was used to assess profiles of early victimization during adolescence (14–17 years). Discrete time survival mixture analysis was used to assess time to treatment entry and substance use disorder diagnosis. Posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and major depressive disorder (MDD) were used as predictors of survival time. Mixture models revealed three profiles of victimization: sustained poly-victimization, moderate/decreasing victimization, and low victimization. Youth in the sustained poly-victimization class were more likely to enter treatment earlier and have a substance use diagnosis earlier than other classes. PTSD was a significant predictor of treatment entry for youth in the sustained poly-victimization class, and MDD was a significant predictor of substance use disorder diagnosis for youth in the moderate/decreasing victimization class. Therefore, substance use prevention programming targeted at youth experiencing poly-victimization in early adolescence—especially those who have PTSD or MDD—is needed.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579419000750,
Adverse childhood experiences and severity levels of inflammation and depression from childhood to young adulthood: a longitudinal cohort study,"Abstract Adverse childhood experiences (ACEs) are associated with depression and systemic inflammation in adults. However, limited longitudinal research has tested these relationships in children and young people, and it is unclear whether inflammation is an underlying mechanism through which ACEs influence depression. We examined the longitudinal associations of several ACEs across different early-life periods with longitudinal patterns of early-life inflammation and depression in young adulthood and assessed the mediating role of inflammation. The data came from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children ( N = 3931). ACEs from the prenatal period through to adolescence were operationalised using cumulative scores, single adversities, and dimensions derived through factor analysis. Inflammation (C-reactive protein) was measured on three occasions (9–18 years) and depressive symptoms were ascertained on four occasions (18–23 years). Latent class growth analysis was employed to delineate group-based trajectories of inflammation and depression. The associations between ACEs and the inflammation/depression trajectories were tested using multinomial logistic regression analysis. Most types of ACEs across all early-life periods were associated with elevated depression trajectories, with larger associations for threat-related adversities compared with other ACEs. Bullying victimisation and sexual abuse in late childhood/adolescence were associated with elevated CRP trajectories, while other ACEs were unrelated to inflammation. Inflammation was also unrelated to depression and did not mediate the associations with ACEs. These results suggest that ACEs are consistently associated with depression, whereas the associations of inflammation with ACEs and depression are weak in young people. Interventions targeting inflammation in this population might not offer protection against depression.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41380-022-01478-x,
Classification and Influential Factors of Longitudinal Changes in the Below-Basic Academic Proficiency Level,"본 연구에서는 초등학생과 중학생의 기초학력 미달이 종단적으로 변화하는 양상에 따라 잠재계층을 분류하고, 잠재계층 분류에 미치는 영향요인을 분석하였다. 이를 위해 『한국교육종단연구2013』의 1차년도부터 5차년도 데이터를 활용하여 잠재계층성장분석(LCGA: latent class growth analysis)과 3단계 접근법(3-step approach) 분석을 실시하였다. 잠재계층 분류 결과, 초기에는 기초학력 미달이 아니었다가 학년이 올라감에 따라 기초학력 미달로 바뀌는 ‘기초학력 미달 전환형’, 지속적으로 기초학력 미달에 해당하는 ‘기초학력 미달 유지형’, 지속적으로 기초학력 미달이 아닌 상태인 ‘기초학력 미달 무관형’의 3가지 유형으로 구분되었다. 주요 연구 결과는 다음과 같다. 첫째, 초·중학교 학생들의 학업성취수준 기초학력 미달 비율은 학년이 올라감에 따라 점점 증가하였다. 둘째, 학생들이 기초학력 미달로 전환되거나 기초학력 미달을 유지하는 데 있어, 학생의 성별, 학업 자아개념, 수업태도, 가정의 사회경제적 지위는 초등학교 5학년 때부터 중학교 3학년 때까지 지속적으로 유의미한 영향을 미쳤다. 셋째, 학생의 진로성숙도가 높을수록 기초학력 미달 전환형이나 기초학력 미달 유지형에 포함될 확률이 높은 것으로 나타났다. 넷째, 부모의 학업적 교육지원은 기초학력 미달 유지형으로 분류되는 데 있어 5개년 동안 지속적으로 영향을 미쳤다. 다섯째, 학생들은 중학교에 진학하게 되면 초등학교 때보다 학교의 영향을 더 많이 받는 경향을 보이는데, 교사가 개별화 수업방식을 많이 활용할수록, 교사의 성취압력과 열의가 높을수록, 학교폭력 경험이 적을수록 학생들이 기초학력 미달로 전환되거나 기초학력 미달을 유지할 확률은 낮아진다. 여섯째, 학생 수가 500명 이하인 소규모 중학교에 다니는 학생일수록 기초학력 미달 전환형과 기초학력 미달 유지형으로 분류될 확률이 높았다. 마지막으로 주요 연구결과를 중심으로 기초학력 미달을 방지하기 위한 정책적 시사점을 제시하였다.This study aimed to identify the latent classes depending on longitudinal changes in the below-basic academic proficiency levels of elementary and middle school students as well as to test the determinants of the classes. The data for this study was drawn from the Korean Education Longitudinal Study 2013 of the Korean Educational Development Institute and latent class growth analysis (LCGA) and the 3-step approach were employed as the analytic method. The results presented that students were classified into three latent classes: ‘Transition to Below-Basic’, ‘Maintenance of Below-Basic’, and ‘Irrelevance with Below-Basic’. The main findings are as follows. First, the percentage of students performing below-basic gradually increased. Second, students’ gender, academic self-concept, attitude in class, and family’s socio-economic status continuously and significantly influenced the possibility of being in the ‘Transition to Below-Basic’ or ‘Maintenance of Below-Basic’ groups from fifth grade to ninth grade. Third, the higher the student’s career maturity, the more likely they were to belong to these groups. Fourth, parents’ academic support for their children positively affected the possibility of being part of the ‘Irrelevance with Below-Basic’ group during the five years. Fifth, students tend to be influenced by school more in middle school than in elementary school. The more individualized the instruction the teacher utilized, the higher their achievement pressure and enthusiasm; additionally, students experiencing lower levels of school violence were less likely to belong to the ‘Transition to Below-Basic’ or ‘Maintenance of Below-Basic’ groups. Lastly, students who attend small middle schools were more prone to belong to the ‘Transition to Below-Basic’ or ‘Maintenance of Below-Basic’ groups. Based on these major research results, the policy implications for preventing below-basic academic proficiency were considered.",https://doi.org/10.30916/kera.59.4.131,
Understanding posttraumatic stress trajectories in adolescent females: A strength-based machine learning approach examining risk and protective factors including online behaviors,"Abstract Heterogeneity in the course of posttraumatic stress symptoms (PTSS) following a major life trauma such as childhood sexual abuse (CSA) can be attributed to numerous contextual factors, psychosocial risk, and family/peer support. The present study investigates a comprehensive set of baseline psychosocial risk and protective factors including online behaviors predicting empirically derived PTSS trajectories over time. Females aged 12–16 years ( N = 440); 156 with substantiated CSA; 284 matched comparisons with various self-reported potentially traumatic events (PTEs) were assessed at baseline and then annually for 2 subsequent years. Latent growth mixture modeling (LGMM) was used to derive PTSS trajectories, and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO) logistic regression was used to investigate psychosocial predictors including online behaviors of trajectories. LGMM revealed four PTSS trajectories: resilient (52.1%), emerging (9.3%), recovering (19.3%), and chronic (19.4%). Of the 23 predictors considered, nine were retained in the LASSO model discriminating resilient versus chronic trajectories including the absence of CSA and other PTEs, low incidences of exposure to sexual content online, minority ethnicity status, and the presence of additional psychosocial protective factors. Results provide insights into possible intervention targets to promote resilience in adolescence following PTEs.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579422000475,
Young‐adult compared to adolescent onset of regular cannabis use: A 20‐year prospective cohort study of later consequences,"This paper compares consequences of cannabis use initiated after high school with those of cannabis initiation in adolescence, with estimates of the proportion of adverse consequences accounted for by adult-onset and adolescent-onset cannabis users.A state-representative sample in Victoria, Australia (n = 1792) participated in a 10-wave longitudinal study and was followed from age 15 to 35 years. Exposure variable: Patterns of cannabis use across 20 years. Outcomes at age 35: Alcohol use, smoking, illicit drug use, relationship status, financial hardship, depression, anxiety and employment status.Substantially more participants (13.6%) initiated regular use after high school (young-adult onset) than in adolescence (7.7%, adolescent onset). By the mid-30s, both young-adult and adolescent-onset regular users were more likely than minimal/non-users (63.5%) to have used other illicit drugs (odds ratio [OR] > 20.4), be a high-risk alcohol drinker (OR > 3.7), smoked daily (OR > 7.2) and less likely to be in relationships (OR < 0.4). As the prevalence of the young-adult-onset group was nearly double of the adolescent-onset group, it accounted for a higher proportion of adverse consequences than the adolescent-onset group.Cannabis users who began regular use in their teens had poorer later life outcomes than non-using peers. The larger group who began regular cannabis use after leaving high school accounted for most cannabis-related harms in adulthood. Given the legalisation of cannabis use in an increasing number of jurisdictions, we should increasingly expect harms from cannabis use to lie in those commencing use in young adulthood.",https://doi.org/10.1111/dar.13239,
Short-term trajectories of workplace bullying and its impact on strain: A latent class growth modeling approach.,"The aim of this weekly diary study was (1) to identify trajectories of workplace bullying over time and (2) to examine the association of each cluster with strain indicators (i.e., insomnia and anxiety/depression).A sample of 286 employees during four weeks of data was used (N occasions = 1144).Results of latent class growth modeling showed that three trajectories could be identified: a non-bullying trajectory, which comprised 90.9% of the sample, an inverted U trajectory, and a delayed increase bullying trajectory, both with 4.2% of the participants.We found a significant interaction between time and trajectories when predicting insomnia and anxiety/depression, showing each strain a differential pattern with each trajectory.It seems that the negative effects on insomnia are long-lasting and remain after bullying has already decreased.In the case of anxiety and depression, when bullying decreases strain indicators also decrease.In this study, by examining trajectories of bullying at work over time and their associations with strain, we provide new insights into the temporal dynamics of workplace bullying",https://doi.org/10.1037/ocp0000232,
An exploratory study of multiple distinct gambling trajectories in emerging adults,"This study uses data from a four-wave longitudinal survey of emerging adults (18–20 years of age in Wave 1) to examine whether there are multiple distinct trajectories of problem gambling risk severity and whether membership in these trajectory classes can be predicted by certain risk and protective factors. Four trajectory classes of gambling risk severity were identified – nonproblem-diminishing (73.9%), low-risk-stable (16.8%), marginal/nongambler-diminishing (7.1%), moderate-risk-increasing (2.2%) – with most youths' gambling involvement remaining stable or diminishing across the years and only the smallest most at-risk group showing a slight increase in severity across this transitional period. Three risk factors were significant predictors of class membership – being male, scoring higher on alcohol dependence, and escape-avoidance coping were all associated with increased probability of being in one of the more gambling involved trajectory classes, while lower alcohol dependence scores were associated with increased likelihood of being in the marginal/nongambling class.",https://doi.org/10.1080/13676261.2014.992326,
Trajectories of childhood neighbourhood cohesion and adolescent mental health: evidence from a national Canadian cohort,"Background The objective of this study was to examine associations between trajectories of childhood neighbourhood social cohesion and adolescent mental health and behaviour. Method This study used data from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth, a nationally representative sample of Canadian children. The sample included 5577 children aged 0–3 years in 1994–1995, prospectively followed until age 12–15 years. Parental perceived neighbourhood cohesion was assessed every 2 years. Latent growth class modelling was used to identify trajectories of neighbourhood cohesion. Mental health and behavioural outcomes were self-reported at age 12–15 years. Logistic regression was used to examine associations between neighbourhood cohesion trajectories and outcomes, adjusting for potential confounders. Results Five distinct trajectories were identified: ‘stable low’ (4.2%); ‘moderate increasing’ (9.1%); ‘stable moderate’ (68.5%); ‘high falling’ (8.9%); and ‘stable high’ (9.3%). Relative to those living in stable moderately cohesive neighbourhoods, those in stable low cohesive neighbourhoods were more likely to experience symptoms of anxiety/depression [odds ratio (OR) = 1.73, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.04–2.90] and engage in indirect aggression (OR = 1.62, 95% CI 1.07–2.45). Those with improvements in neighbourhood cohesion had significantly lower odds of hyperactivity (OR = 0.67, 95% CI 0.46–0.98) and indirect aggression (OR = 0.69, 95% CI 0.49–0.96). In contrast, those with a decline in neighbourhood cohesion had increased odds of hyperactivity (OR = 1.67, 95% CI 1.21–2.29). Those in highly cohesive neighbourhoods in early childhood were more likely to engage in prosocial behaviour (‘high falling’: OR = 1.93, 95% CI 1.38–2.69; ‘stable high’: OR = 1.89, 95% CI 1.35–2.63). Conclusions These results suggest that neighbourhood cohesion in childhood may have time-sensitive effects on several domains of adolescent mental health and behaviour.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291715001245,
Impulsivity profiles across five harmonized longitudinal childhood preventive interventions and associations with adult outcomes,"Abstract This study aimed to parse between-person heterogeneity in growth of impulsivity across childhood and adolescence among participants enrolled in five childhood preventive intervention trials targeting conduct problems. In addition, we aimed to test profile membership in relation to adult psychopathologies. Measurement items representing impulsive behavior across grades 2, 4, 5, 7, 8, and 10, and aggression, substance use, suicidal ideation/attempts, and anxiety/depression in adulthood were integrated from the five trials ( N = 4,975). We applied latent class growth analysis to this sample, as well as samples separated into nonintervention ( n = 2,492) and intervention ( n = 2,483) participants. Across all samples, profiles were characterized by high, moderate, low, and low-increasing impulsive levels. Regarding adult outcomes, in all samples, the high, moderate, and low profiles endorsed greater levels of aggression compared to the low-increasing profile. There were nuanced differences across samples and profiles on suicidal ideation/attempts and anxiety/depression. Across samples, there were no significant differences between profiles on substance use. Overall, our study helps to inform understanding of the developmental course and prognosis of impulsivity, as well as adding to collaborative efforts linking data across multiple studies to better inform understanding of developmental processes.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579424000828,
Assessing the trend of HIV/AIDS mortality rate in Asia and North Africa: an application of latent growth models,"Over the last 30 years, HIV/AIDS has emerged as a major global health challenge. This study evaluates the change of HIV/AIDS mortality rates in Asian and North African countries from 1990 to 2010 using the Global Burden of Disease (GBD) study. HIV/AIDS mortality rates were derived from the GBD database from 1990 to 2010, for 52 countries in Asia and North Africa. First, a Latent Growth Model was employed to assess the change in AIDS mortality rate over time in six different regions of Asia, and also the change in AIDS mortality rate over time for males and females in Asia and North Africa. Finally, Latent Growth Mixture Models (LGMMs) were applied to identify distinct groups in which countries within each group have similar trends over time. Our results showed that increase in mortality rate over time for males is about three times greater than for females. The highest and lowest trend of AIDS mortality rates were observed in South-East Asia and high-income Asia-Pacific regions, respectively. The LGMM allocated most countries in the South and South-East region into two classes with the highest trend of AIDS mortality rates. Although the HIV/AIDS mortality rates are decreasing in some countries and clusters, the general trend in the Asian continent is upwards. Therefore, it is necessary to provide programmes to achieve the goal of access to HIV prevention measures, treatment, care, and support for high-risk groups, especially in countries with a higher trend of AIDS mortality rates.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0950268815001351,
Risk and resilience in trajectories of post-traumatic stress symptoms among first responders after the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake: 7-year prospective cohort study,"Background First responders to disasters are at risk of developing post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). The trajectories of post-traumatic stress symptom severity differ among individuals, even if they are exposed to similar events. These trajectories have not yet been reported in non-Western first responders. Aims We aimed to explore post-traumatic stress symptom severity trajectories and their risk factors in first responders to the 2011 Great East Japan Earthquake (GEJE) – a historically large earthquake that resulted in a tsunami and a nuclear disaster. Method A total of 55 632 Japan Ground Self-Defense Force (JGSDF) personnel dispatched to the GEJE were enrolled in this 7-year longitudinal cohort study. PTSD symptom severity was measured using the Impact of Event Scale-Revised. Trajectories were identified using latent growth mixture models (LGMM). Nine potential risk factors for the symptom severity trajectories were analysed using multinomial logistic regression. Results Five symptom severity trajectories were identified: ‘resilient’ (54.8%), ‘recovery’ (24.6%), ‘incomplete recovery’ (10.7%), ‘late-onset’ (5.7%), and ‘chronic’ (4.3%). The main risk factors for the four non-resilient trajectories were older age, personal disaster experiences and working conditions. These working conditions included duties involving body recovery or radiation exposure risk, longer deployment length, later or no post-deployment leave and longer post-deployment overtime. Conclusions The majority of first responders to GEJE were resilient and developed few or no PTSD symptoms. A substantial minority experienced late-onset and chronic symptom severity trajectories. The identified risk factors can inform policies for prevention, early detection and intervention in individuals at risk of developing symptomatic trajectories.",https://doi.org/10.1192/bjp.2022.2,
Forgiveness and gratitude trajectories among persons undergoing alcohol addiction therapy,"Background: The first studies concerning changes in moral virtues during alcohol addiction therapy were published during the last decade. However, as all of these studies applied a variable-oriented approach, it is impossible to capture differences between starting points and changes in variables of interest. Method: In this study, we employed a person-oriented approach to identify trajectories of change in two moral virtues—forgiveness and gratitude—during alcohol addiction treatment. The sample consisted of 358 alcohol-dependent individuals who were receiving outpatient therapy. Measurements were taken (1) at the beginning of the basic treatment, (2) after its completion (5–7 weeks from baseline), and (3) about six months later. Three forgiveness scales and the Gratitude Questionnaire (GQ-6) were used to assess the patients' moral virtues. Results: Latent class growth analysis (LCGA) revealed four trajectories for self-forgiveness and gratitude, and three trajectories for forgiveness of others and feeling forgiven by God. For patients with a low baseline level of moral virtues, the changes varied depending on the kind of moral virtue. Patients with a relatively high initial level of moral virtues maintained that level in subsequent measurements. Significant correlates of trajectory class membership were gender, education, age, religiosity, diagnosis of coexisting psychiatric disorders, and frequency of attending Alcoholics Anonymous (AA) meetings. Conclusions: This study highlights the clinical importance of considering differences at the baseline level and in changes of forgiveness and gratitude, as well as personal and alcohol-related correlates of trajectory group membership among people who participate in alcohol addiction therapy.",https://doi.org/10.1080/16066359.2018.1429595,
"Developmental continuity and change in physical, verbal, and relational aggression and peer victimization from childhood to adolescence.","To investigate the developmental course of aggression and peer victimization in childhood and adolescence, distinct subgroups of children were identified based on similarities and differences in their physical, verbal and relational aggression, and victimization. Developmental continuity and change were assessed by examining transitions within and between subgroups from Grades 1 to 11. This longitudinal study consisted of 482 children (50% females) and was based on peer report data on multiple forms of aggression and peer victimization. Using person-centered methods including latent profile and latent transition analyses, most of the identified subgroups were distinguishable by their frequencies (i.e., levels) of aggression and victimization, rather than forms (physical, verbal, and relational), with the exception of 1 group that appeared to be more form-specific. Across subgroups, multiple developmental patterns emerged characterized as early and late-onset, social interactional continuity, desistance, and heterotypic pathways. Collectively, these pathways support the perspective that the development of aggression and peer victimization in childhood and adolescence is characterized by heterogeneity.

Trajectories of posttraumatic stress disorders among children after the Wenchuan earthquake: a four-year longitudinal study,"Background: Previous research has demonstrated heterogeneous patterns of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among children following disasters. However, no clear consensus has been reached regarding the postdisaster trajectories of PTSD among children.Objective: The current study examined the trajectories of PTSD among children after exposure to the Wenchuan earthquake and explored potential predictors of distinct PTSD trajectories.Methods: A four-year longitudinal study was conducted to follow 301 children who were evaluated for PTSD symptoms following the Wenchuan earthquake. Trauma exposure and some pre-existing characteristics were measured at four months after the disaster, and PTSD symptoms were measured at 4, 16, 29, 40 and 52 months after the disaster. The trajectories were identified with Latent Growth Mixture Modelling, and the predictors were explored with multinomial logistic regression.Results: The following three latent PTSD trajectories were found among children: resilient (74.9%), relapsing (17.7%) and recovery (7.5%). Trauma exposure was more likely to be related to a more severe trajectory of PTSD, having experienced prequake trauma was more likely to be related to the recovery trajectory and school 2 was more likely to be related to the relapsing trajectory.Conclusion: These findings provide novel insights into children's postdisaster response patterns. Individual heterogeneity existed in posttraumatic reactions. This longer-term longitudinal study captured more detailed and accurate information about the development of these trajectories. Trauma exposure and previous traumatic experience were linked to malignant development of PTSD.",https://doi.org/10.1080/20008198.2019.1586266,
"Costs and benefits of children’s physical and relational aggression trajectories on peer rejection, acceptance, and friendships: Variations by aggression subtypes, gender, and age.","This study examined the associations between children's co-occurring relational and physical aggression trajectories and their peer relations (i.e., peer rejection, peer acceptance, and reciprocated friendships) from late childhood (Grade 4; Mage = 10.0) to early adolescence (Grade 8; Mage = 13.9). Using a sample of 477 children (240 girls), the findings indicated there were multiple heterogeneous subgroups of children who followed distinct co-occurring aggression trajectories. For each of these subgroups, multiple indices of their relational development were assessed and findings revealed notable group differences. These results have implications about the potential costs and benefits of aggression, and how its associations with children's peer relationships may vary as a function of aggression subtype, developmental timing, and gender.",https://doi.org/10.1037/dev0000057,
"A life course perspective on mental health problems, employment, and work outcomes","Objectives Little is known about how employment and work outcomes among young adults are influenced by their life-course history of mental health problems. Therefore, the aims of this study were to (i) identify trajectories of mental health problems from childhood to young adulthood and (ii) investigate the association between these trajectories and employment and work outcomes among young adults. Methods Data were used from 360 participants of the Tracking Adolescents’ Individual Lives Survey (TRAILS), a Dutch prospective cohort study, with 12-year follow-up. Trajectories of externalizing and internalizing problems were identified with latent class growth models. Employment conditions and work outcomes (ie, psychosocial work characteristics) were measured at age 22. We assessed the association between mental health trajectories and employment conditions and work outcomes. Results Four trajectories of mental health problems were identified: high-stable, decreasing, moderate-stable and low-stable. Young adults with high-stable trajectories of externalizing problems worked over six hours more [B=6.71, 95% confidence interval (95% CI) 2.82–10.6] and had a higher income [odds ratio (OR) 0.33, 95% CI 0.15–0.71], than young adults with low-stable trajectories. Young adults with high-stable trajectories of internalizing problems worked six hours less per week (B=-6.07, 95% CI -10.1– -2.05) and reported lower income (OR 3.44, 95% CI 1.53–7.74) and poorer psychosocial work characteristics, compared to young adults with low-stable trajectories. Conclusions Among young adults who had a paid job at the age of 22 (and were not a student or unemployed), those with a history of internalizing problems are less likely to transition successfully into the labor market, compared to other young adults.",https://doi.org/10.5271/sjweh.3651,
"An overview of structural equation modeling: its beginnings, historical development, usefulness and controversies in the social sciences","Abstract This paper is a tribute to researchers who have significantly contributed to improving and advancing structural equation modeling (SEM). It is, therefore, a brief overview of SEM and presents its beginnings, historical development, its usefulness in the social sciences and the statistical and philosophical (theoretical) controversies which have often appeared in the literature pertaining to SEM. Having described the essence of SEM in the context of causal analysis, the author discusses the years of the development of structural modeling as the consequence of many researchers’ systematically growing needs (in particular in the social sciences) who strove to effectively understand the structure and interactions of latent phenomena. The early beginnings of SEM models were related to the work of Spearman and Wright, and to that of other prominent researchers who contributed to SEM development. The importance and predominance of theoretical assumptions over technical issues for the successful construction of SEM models are also described. Then, controversies regarding the use of SEM in the social sciences are presented. Finally, the opportunities and threats of this type of analytical strategy as well as selected areas of SEM applications in the social sciences are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11135-017-0469-8,

Joint developmental trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems from mid-childhood to late adolescence and childhood risk factors: Findings from a prospective pre-birth cohort,"Abstract There is limited evidence on heterogenous co-developmental trajectories of internalizing (INT) and externalizing (EXT) problems from childhood to adolescence and predictors of these joint trajectories. We utilized longitudinal data from Raine Study participants ( n = 2393) to identify these joint trajectories from 5 to 17 years using parallel-process latent class growth analysis and analyze childhood individual and family risk factors predicting these joint trajectories using multinomial logistic regression. Five trajectory classes were identified: Low-problems (Low-INT/Low-EXT, 29%), Moderate Externalizing (Moderate-EXT/Low-INT, 26.5%), Primary Internalizing (Moderate High-INT/Low-EXT, 17.5%), Co-occurring (High-INT/High-EXT, 17%), High Co-occurring (Very High-EXT/High-INT, 10%). Children classified in Co-occurring and High Co-occurring trajectories (27% of the sample) exhibited clinically meaningful co-occurring problem behaviors and experienced more adverse childhood risk-factors than other three trajectories. Compared with Low-problems : parental marital problems, low family income, and absent father predicted Co-occurring and High Co-occurring trajectories; maternal mental health problems commonly predicted Primary Internalizing, Co-occurring , and High Co-occurring trajectories; male sex and parental tobacco-smoking uniquely predicted High Co-occurring membership; other substance smoking uniquely predicted Co-occurring membership; speech difficulty uniquely predicted Primary Internalizing membership; child’s temper-tantrums predicted all four trajectories, with increased odds ratios for High Co-occurring (OR = 8.95) and Co-occurring (OR = 6.07). Finding two co-occurring trajectories emphasizes the importance of early childhood interventions addressing comorbidity.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579423001505,
Addressing ethnic prejudice in youth: Developmental trajectories and associations with educational identity,"Studying how attitudes develop in the transition from late adolescence to emerging adulthood offers unique insights into future generations’ perceptions of society and of others. However, findings on ethnic prejudice during this life period are mixed. The current research aims to examine the development of affective and cognitive ethnic prejudice, adopting a person-centered approach. Furthermore, it examines the associations between educational identity processes and prejudice. A sample of 297 Italian adolescents ( M age = 17.48, SD age = 0.79, 37.8% males) participated in a five-wave longitudinal study. At the mean level, cognitive prejudice decreased slightly over time, while affective prejudice remained stable. Additionally, rank-order stability coefficients were high ( r ≥ .526). Moreover, for each dimension of prejudice (i.e., cognitive and affective) taken separately, three groups of participants were identified based on their high, moderate, or low scores, respectively. Finally, higher levels of educational identity in-depth exploration at baseline significantly increased the chances of adolescents falling into the low rather than the moderate group for both cognitive and affective prejudice. Conversely, it significantly reduced the chances of being in the high compared to the moderate group for affective prejudice. This study highlights the importance of considering multiple components of prejudice and their reciprocal associations with identity processes to identify at-risk segments of the adolescent and emerging adult populations.",https://doi.org/10.1177/08902070221123785,
Trajectory classes of cannabis use and heavy drinking among rural African American adolescents: multi‐level predictors of class membership,"Abstract Aims To inform research on the etiology and prevention of substance use among rural African American youth by (a) identifying developmental trajectory classes of cannabis use and heavy drinking across adolescence and young adulthood and (b) examining associations between trajectory class membership and multi‐level assessments of risk factors. Design A prospective study spanning 9 years with assessments of cannabis use and heavy drinking, the catecholamines epinephrine and norepinephrine, perceived stress and psychosocial risk factors. Setting Rural communities in the southeastern United States. Participants African American youth ( n = 518). Measurements Participants were assessed for cannabis use and heavy drinking at seven assessments beginning at 16 years of age and continuing to 25 years of age. At age 19, participants provided overnight urine voids that were assayed for catecholamines, a biological marker of life stress resulting from sympathetic nervous system activation. At ages 16 and 19, participants provided information on malleable psychosocial risk factors. Findings Latent class growth models revealed three distinct trajectory classes for cannabis use and for heavy drinking. Higher levels of circulating stress hormones and perceived stress were associated with classes reporting greater substance use over time (all P s &lt; 0.05). A composite of selected risk factors discriminated class membership (all P s &lt; 0.05). Trajectory classes characterized by rapid usage increases in early adulthood exhibited the greatest increase in deviant peer affiliations between ages 16 and 19 years. Conclusions Rural African American youth's cannabis use and heavy drinking across adolescence and young adulthood demonstrate distinct developmental courses; a small number of risk factors and measures of biological and perceived stress differentiate class membership prognostically. Variability over time in these measures, specifically an increase in deviant peer affiliation, may help to account for steep increases in young adulthood.",https://doi.org/10.1111/add.14200,
Assessing phenotypic and polygenic models of <scp>ADHD</scp> to identify mechanisms of risk for longitudinal trajectories of externalizing behaviors,"Children with ADHD frequently engage in higher rates of externalizing behaviors in adulthood relative to children without. However, externalizing behaviors vary across development. Little is known about how this risk unfolds across development. Phenotypic and polygenic models of childhood ADHD were used to predict individual differences in adult externalizing trajectories. Supportive parenting, school connectedness, and peer closeness were then examined as causal mechanisms.Data were from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N = 7,674). Externalizing behavior was measured using data from age 18 to 32 and modeled using latent class growth analysis. Child ADHD was measured using retrospective self-report (phenotypic model) and genome-wide polygenic risk scores (polygenic model). Multiple mediation models examined the direct and indirect effects of the phenotypic and polygenic models (separately) on externalizing trajectories through the effects of adolescent supportive parenting, school connectedness, and peer closeness.Phenotypic and polygenic models of ADHD were associated with being in the High Decreasing (3.2% of sample) and Moderate (16.1%) adult externalizing trajectories, but not the severe Low Increasing trajectory (2.6%), relative to the Normal trajectory (78.2%). Associations between both models of ADHD on the High Decreasing and Moderate trajectories were partially mediated through the effects of school connectedness, but not supportive parenting or peer closeness.Findings shed light on how childhood ADHD affects downstream psychosocial processes that then predict specific externalizing outcomes in adulthood. They also reinforce the importance of fostering a strong school environment for adolescents with (and without) ADHD, as this context plays a critical role in shaping the development of externalizing behaviors in adulthood.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13071,
Understanding and predicting the longitudinal course of dementia,"To date, most research in dementia has focused either on the identification of dementia risk prediction or on understanding changes and predictors experienced by individuals before diagnosis. Despite little is known about how individuals change after dementia diagnosis, there is agreement that changes occur over different time scales and are multidomain. In this study, we present an overview of the literature regarding the longitudinal course of dementia.Our review suggests the evidence is scarce and findings reported are often inconsistent. We identified large heterogeneity in dementia trajectories, risk factors considered and modelling approaches employed. The heterogeneity of dementia trajectories also varies across outcomes and domains investigated.It became clear that dementia progresses very differently, both between and within individuals. This implies an average trajectory is not informative to individual persons and this needs to be taken into account when communicating prognosis in clinical care. As persons with dementia change in many more ways during their patient journey, heterogeneous disease progressions are the result of disease and patient characteristics. Prognostic models would benefit from including variables across a number of domains. International coordination of replication and standardization of the research approach is recommended.",https://doi.org/10.1097/yco.0000000000000482,
"Factor Predicting Maternal Posttraumatic Stress Symptom Trajectories Following a Natural Disaster: Coping, Social Support, and Family Functioning","Natural disasters are sudden, large-scale events that are associated with significant mental health consequences. Although, most individuals demonstrate resilience, a significant subset of the population develops significant long-term distress (La Greca et al. 2013; Lai, et al., 2015; Lowe & Rhodes 2013; Self-Brown et al., 2014). Moreover, results from emerging longitudinal research suggests that symptom patterns are heterogenous. For example, some individuals recover over time or demonstrate a delayed onset. The most commonly studied post-disaster reaction in adults is posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms. However, the extant literature examining elevated PTS symptoms and related risk factors in disaster research has relied largely on cross-sectional post-hoc designs, with few studies examining PTS symptom trajectories from a longitudinal perspective. The current study sought to build upon post-disaster recovery theory, by examining PTS trajectories in a diverse sample of primarily low-income mothers impacted by Hurricane Katrina, as well as identifying predictor variables (i.e., prior trauma, hurricane exposure, coping behavior, social support, and family functioning) associated with specific symptom trajectories. Data was collected over two years following the Hurricane Katrina (2005-2007). Utilizing Latent Class Growth Analysis, results revealed that a three-trajectory model (i.e., recovering, chronic, and resilient) best fit the data. Significant risk and protective factors differentiating trajectory membership included prior trauma, hurricane-related loss and disruption, social support, and children’s internalizing symptoms. Implications of study findings and directions for future research are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.31390/gradschool_dissertations.5345,
청소년기 자존감 다중 변화궤적 잠재계층에 따른 장래의 우울과 공격행동,"This study aims to identify the number of latent classes that show the multiple trajectories ofself-esteem in adolescents and the mean differences among the latent classes of self-esteem in depression andaggression in the future. This study used four waves of longitudinal data from Korean Children and Youth PanelSurvey(KCYPS, 2010-2015). Subjects were the 2064 adolescents who were born in 1997. They were derived fromthe 2351 adolescents in the first year student panel in the middle school. The latent growth mixture model andthe one-way analysis of variance were used for data analysis. The major findings were as follows: this studyidentified four different latent classes: stable high self-esteem without growth, moderate but increasedself-esteem, and low but increased self-esteem, then chronic low pattern of self-esteem without growth. Theadolescents in the stable high self-esteem latent class showed lower depression and aggression in the futurethan the other latent classes. Based on the findings of this study, the researchers suggested practical implicationsin counseling for increasing self-esteem in the adolescents.",,
Smoking Trajectory Classes and Impact of Social Smoking Identity in Two Cohorts of U.S. Young Adults,"This study describes cigarette smoking trajectories, the influence of social smoker self-identification (SSID), and correlates of these trajectories in two cohorts of U.S. young adults: a sample from the Chicago metropolitan area (Social Emotional Contexts of Adolescent and Young Adult Smoking Patterns [SECAP], n = 893) and a national sample (Truth Initiative Young Adult Cohort Study [YA Cohort], n = 1,491). Using latent class growth analyses and growth mixture models, five smoking trajectories were identified in each sample: in SECAP: nonsmoking ( n = 658, 73.7%), declining smoking ( n = 20, 2.2%), moderate/stable smoking ( n = 114, 12.8%), high/stable smoking ( n = 79, 8.9%), and escalating smoking ( n = 22, 2.5%); and in YA Cohort: nonsmoking ( n = 1,215, 81.5%), slowly declining smoking ( n = 52, 3.5%), rapidly declining smoking ( n = 50, 3.4%), stable smoking ( n = 139, 9%), and escalating smoking ( n = 35, 2.4%). SSID was most prevalent in moderate/stable smoking (35.5% SECAP), rapidly declining smoking (25.2% YA Cohort), and nonsmoking. Understanding nuances of how smoking identity is formed and used to limit or facilitate smoking behavior in young adults will allow for more effective interventions to reduce tobacco use.",https://doi.org/10.1177/2167696818763949,
Trajectories of attachment in older age: interpersonal trauma and its consequences,"Previous studies suggest that attachment insecurities may increase after trauma exposure, an effect documented only at a group level. This study explores the heterogeneity of changes over time and examines the associations of the nature of the traumatic event (interpersonal and nonpersonal), and its consequences (posttraumatic stress disorder [PTSD] and loneliness) with attachment trajectories. Two groups of Israeli veterans participated: 164 former prisoners-of-war and 185 combat veterans. Attachment was assessed at four points (1991–2015). Risk factors were evaluated in 1991. Using latent growth mixture modeling, trajectories of attachment insecurities were explored. Three avoidance trajectories (stability, decrease, inverse u-shaped) and two anxiety trajectories (stability, decrease) were identified. The inverse u-shaped avoidance trajectory was associated with captivity, humiliation, loneliness, and PTSD, and stable avoidance was associated with loneliness. Stable anxiety was associated with captivity and loneliness. Attachment insecurities can change during aging and persist decades after a trauma. Trauma-related risk factors are related to more deleterious trajectories.",https://doi.org/10.1080/14616734.2018.1479871,
Trajectories of Lifetime Comorbid Alcohol and Other Drug Use Disorders Through Midlife,"Objective: Very few studies have examined the developmental nature of comorbid alcohol use disorders and drug use disorders (AUD-DUD). The current study sought to extend our understanding of the nature of AUD-DUD comorbidity by characterizing the developmental course of AUD-DUD comorbidity, determining the degree to which the two disorders occur during the same period, and eliciting differences in AUD-DUD trajectories over the life course. Method: Vietnam-era male veterans and matched civilians provided retrospective accounts of alcohol-and other drug–related experiences spanning 25 years. Concurrent growth mixture modeling was used to describe the course of AUD-DUD lifetime comorbidity. Results: Five trajectories were identified based on the probabilities of diagnosing with AUD-DUD: substance switching (increasing AUD, decreasing DUD); young adult (both AUD and DUD decreasing rapidly after young adulthood); severe nonchronic (both AUD and DUD decreasing slowly in the third decade of life); severe chronic alcohol–severe nonchronic drug (AUD remains high and DUD decreases in the fourth decade); and young adult alcohol–severe chronic drug (decreasing AUD in the second decade and DUD remains high). Conclusions: For the majority of this sample, substance use disorders continued or worsened through adulthood, indicating a problem that extends far beyond young adulthood. Demographic characteristics differed among the trajectories; however, psychiatric diagnoses did not differ except for the number of years with diagnoses of antisocial personality disorder. Subthreshold symptoms in adulthood may be present for a significant period before diagnosis, making this period important for intervention and prevention. Integration of efforts into healthcare, employment, and public policy will help target those at highest risk.",https://doi.org/10.15288/jsad.2015.76.721,
Late adolescent outcomes of different developmental trajectories of ADHD symptoms in a large longitudinal study,"Background: There exists substantial heterogeneity in the developmental trajectories of ADHD symptoms, with distinctions often made between persistent versus remittent, and early- versus late-onset. However, how these trajectories relate to late adolescent functioning and whether, in particular, later onset trajectories mark a milder subtype remains unclear. Methods: We applied latent class growth analysis to data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (N = 16,703) to evaluate whether developmental trajectories of ADHD symptoms (ages 3-17) were associated with differing levels of impairment in peer problems, mental health, substance use, and delinquency at age 17. Results: Our optimal model included five trajectory groups, labelled unaffected (37.6%), mildly affected (34.8%), subclinical remitting (14.4%), adolescent onset (7.6%), and stable high (5.6%). Adolescent onset and stable high trajectories were similarly impaired across all outcomes, other than substance use. Subclinical remitting individuals were impaired on self-esteem and well-being compared to unaffected individuals. Conclusions: By adolescence, those with a later onset have similar impairments to those following an early onset/persistent trajectory. Residual impairment remains for those on a remitting trajectory.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/eb3vj,
Interpreting and Testing Interactions in Conditional Mixture Models,"Mixture modeling applications in psychology often include covariates to explain class membership and aid in construct validation of the latent classification variable. These applications tend to use between-class models involving only main effects of predictors. However, a variety of developmental theories posit interactions among risk and protective variables in predicting membership in trajectory classes or behavioral symptom profiles. This article bridges this disconnect between substantive theory and methodological practice by presenting and comparing two approaches for testing interactive effects of predictors on class membership: product term (PT) and multiple group (MG) approaches. For each approach, we discuss alternative interpretation strategies involving predicted probabilities and odds ratios; we also discuss when the approaches provide equivalent inferences. Published longitudinal and cross-sectional mixture model applications that had originally allowed for only additive effects on class membership are re-analyzed to illustrate the testing and interpretation of interactive effects on class membership using both PT and MG approaches.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10888691.2015.1046987,
"Association among multimorbidity, physical disability and depression trajectories: a study of urban–rural differences in China","Abstract Purpose The purpose of this study was to analyse the trajectories of depression in urban and rural areas, and to analyse the relationship among multimorbidity, disability and other variables and trajectories. Methods Data from the China Health and Retirement Longitudinal Study were used. A latent class growth model was used to characterise the trajectories of urban and rural depression symptoms. Chi-square test was used to test the differences in respondents’ characteristics among depression trajectories groups within urban and rural areas. The relationships among multimorbidity, disability and depression symptom trajectories were analysed via multinomial logistic regression. Results Urban and rural depression trajectories were divided into three categories. Respondents in urban areas were divided into rising, remaining-low and declining group, and those in rural areas were divided into rising, remaining-low and remaining-high group. The depression scores of respondents with multimorbidity were more likely to rise, and this result was similar for the disabled respondents. Respondents who need help on activities of daily living and instrumental activities of daily living in urban areas were more likely to decline in depression scores. In rural areas, however, the values were consistently high. In urban and rural areas, the relationships among marital status, education and age and depression trajectories were different. Conclusions The depression trajectories are different in urban and rural China. Improving the quality of medical services, promoting the distribution of rural social resources and implementing more recreational activities could be beneficial for the promotion of mental health in rural areas.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11136-021-02807-3,
"Emerging experience with selected new categories in the <scp>ICD</scp>‐11: complex <scp>PTSD</scp>, prolonged grief disorder, gaming disorder, and compulsive sexual behaviour disorder","Among the important changes in the ICD-11 is the addition of 21 new mental disorders. New categories are typically proposed to: a) improve the usefulness of morbidity statistics; b) facilitate recognition of a clinically important but poorly classified mental disorder in order to provide appropriate management; and c) stimulate research into more effective treatments. Given the major implications for the field and for World Health Organization (WHO) member states, it is important to examine the impact of these new categories during the early phase of the ICD-11 implementation. This paper focuses on four disorders: complex post-traumatic stress disorder, prolonged grief disorder, gaming disorder, and compulsive sexual behaviour disorder. These categories were selected because they have been the focus of considerable activity and/or controversy and because their inclusion in the ICD-11 represents a different decision than was made for the DSM-5. The lead authors invited experts on each of these disorders to provide insight into why it was considered important to add it to the ICD-11, implications for care of not having that diagnostic category, important controversies about adding the disorder, and a review of the evidence generated and other developments related to the category since the WHO signaled its intention to include it in the ICD-11. Each of the four diagnostic categories appears to describe a population with clinically important and distinctive features that had previously gone unrecognized as well as specific treatment needs that would otherwise likely go unmet. The introduction of these categories in the ICD-11 has been followed by a substantial expansion of research in each area, which has generally supported their validity and utility, and by a significant increase in the availability of appropriate services.",https://doi.org/10.1002/wps.20960,
Identifying Trajectories of Borderline Personality Features in Adolescence,"Objective: To examine trajectories of adolescent borderline personality (BP) features in a normative-risk cohort ( n = 566) of Canadian children assessed at ages 13, 14, 15, and 16 and childhood predictors of trajectory group membership assessed at ages 8, 10, 11, and 12. Method: Data were drawn from the McMaster Teen Study, an on-going study examining relations among bullying, mental health, and academic achievement. Participants and their parents completed a battery of mental health and peer relations questionnaires at each wave of the study. Academic competence was assessed at age 8 (Grade 3). Latent class growth analysis, analysis of variance, and logistic regression were used to analyze the data. Results: Three distinct BP features trajectory groups were identified: elevated or rising, intermediate or stable, and low or stable. Parent- and child-reported mental health symptoms, peer relations risk factors, and intra-individual risk factors were significant predictors of elevated or rising and intermediate or stable trajectory groups. Child-reported attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and somatization symptoms uniquely predicted elevated or rising trajectory group membership, whereas parent-reported anxiety and child-reported ADHD symptoms uniquely predicted intermediate or stable trajectory group membership. Child-reported somatization symptoms was the only predictor to differentiate the intermediate or stable and elevated or rising trajectory groups (OR 1.15, 95% CI 1.04 to 1.28). Associations between child-reported reactive temperament and elevated BP features trajectory group membership were 10.23 times higher among children who were bullied, supporting a diathesis–stress pathway in the development of BP features for these youth. Conclusions: Findings demonstrate the heterogeneous course of BP features in early adolescence and shed light on the potential prodromal course of later borderline personality disorder.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0706743715625953,
Social anxiety symptoms among youth with chronic health conditions: trajectories and related factors,"Purpose: This study explored three-year trajectories of social anxiety symptoms among youth with chronic health conditions and investigated factors influencing those trajectories.Methods: Participants (N = 439) were recruited from eight pediatric rehabilitation centers. The Social Anxiety Scale for Children-Revised measured social anxiety across four time points. Latent Class Growth Analysis was used to study trajectories and logistic regression to identify related factors.Results: A three-class solution was supported: a ""high anxiety and stable"" group (17.1%), a ""moderate anxiety and stable"" group (44.4%), and a ""low anxiety and stable"" group (38.5%). Youth in the ""moderate and stable"" group were less likely to be male compared to the ""low and stable"" group. Youth in the ""high and stable"" group were more likely to have greater cognitive symptoms and less likely to have higher levels of social participation compared to the ""low and stable"" group. Youth in both the ""high and stable"" and ""moderate and stable"" groups were less likely to have high support from classmates or close friends compared to the ""low and stable"" group. Moreover, both the ""high and stable"" and ""moderate and stable"" groups were less likely to have positive family functioning.Conclusion: Youth with chronic conditions belonging to ""high and stable"" and ""moderate and stable"" social anxiety trajectories can be distinguished from those in a ""low and stable"" trajectory using personal, functional, and environmental level variables.Implications for RehabilitationYouth with chronic health conditions are at risk of developing and maintaining moderate to high levels of social anxiety symptoms as they move through adolescence.Compared to youth with ""low and stable"" social anxiety, those with ""moderate and stable"" social anxiety are less likely to be male, have high peer support or high family functioning.Compared to youth with ""low and stable"" social anxiety, those with ""high and stable"" social anxiety are more likely to have greater cognitive symptoms, and less likely to have high social participation, high peer support, or high family functioning.Rehabilitation and other professionals should not only consider factors that are functional in nature; they should also consider personal and environmental level factors when supporting youth with chronic health conditions who experience social anxiety symptoms.",https://doi.org/10.1080/09638288.2019.1590742,
Trajectories of post‐traumatic stress disorder symptoms among youth exposed to both natural and technological disasters,"Background Theorists and researchers have demonstrated multiple trajectories of symptoms following disasters ( Ecology and Society , 13 , 2008, 9), highlighting the importance of obtaining more knowledge about exposed youth who demonstrate resilience as well as those who suffer chronic difficulties. This paper examines trajectories of post‐traumatic stress disorder ( PTSD ) symptoms following exposure to hurricanes and the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill to increase understanding of resilience and chronic reactions to both natural and technological disasters. Methods A multiwave longitudinal design was used to follow N = 4,619 youth who were evaluated for PTSD symptoms, hurricane exposure, and oil spill exposure/stress at four time points over a period of 4 years. Trajectories were identified with cluster analyses and multilevel modeling. Results Individual trajectories were statistically identified consistent with theory. The largest group exhibited stable‐low symptoms (52%), a second group showed steep declines following initial symptoms (21%), a third group exhibited increasing symptoms (18%), and a fourth group showed stable‐high symptoms (9%). Both hurricane exposure and oil spill stress predicted trajectories and overall levels of PTSD symptoms. Conclusions Results identified an effect of oil spill stress and hurricane exposure on symptom levels and trajectories of exposed youth. Results provide prospective data to support theories of multiple symptom trajectories following disasters and reinforce the importance of research that utilizes a developmental perspective to consider the long‐term effects of disasters in youth. Findings highlight the importance of identifying symptoms and predictors of resilience as well as factors that contribute to resilience.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.12420,
"Modeling trajectories of physical aggression from infancy to pre-school age, their early predictors, and school-age outcomes","This study identified latent trajectories of physical aggression (TPA) from infancy to preschool age and evaluated (a) effects of early parent, parenting and child predictors on TPA as well as on social, behavioral, and academic functioning in Grade 2, and (b) TPA effects net of early predictor effects on Grade 2 functioning. We used data from the Behavior Outlook Norwegian Developmental Study (BONDS), which included 1,159 children (559 girls). Parents reported on risk and protective factors, and on physical aggression from 1 to 5 years of age; teachers reported on Grade 2 outcomes. We employed latent class growth curve analyses and identified nine TPA. In fully adjusted models simultaneously testing all associations among predictors, trajectories, and outcomes, maternal and paternal harsh parenting, child gender, and sibling presence predicted TPA, which significantly predicted externalizing and academic competence in Grade 2. Child gender had a pervasive influence on all outcomes as well as on TPA. To our knowledge, this is the first trajectory study to determine which predictors are most proximal, more distal, or just confounded, with their relative direct effect sizes, and to link early paternal as well as maternal harsh parenting practices with children’s TPA. Our findings underscore the need to include fathers in developmental research and early prevention and intervention efforts.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0291704,
One-year trajectory analysis for ADHD symptoms and its associated factors in community-based children and adolescents in Taiwan,"Several longitudinal studies have shown the partial symptomatic persistence of attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) in clinic-based samples. However, little is known about the patterns and trajectories of ADHD symptoms in community-based populations.To differentiate developmental trajectories of ADHD symptoms over 1 year, with a four-wave quarterly follow-up in children and adolescents in the community of Taiwan, we conducted this prospective study in 1281 students in grade 3, 5, and 8. All the students in the regular classes rather than special educational classes were eligible and recruited to the study. Inattention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, and opposition-defiance were rated by parent reports on the Chinese version of the Swanson, Nolan, and Pelham Version IV Scale (SNAP-IV). Group-based trajectory modeling and multivariable regression analyses were used to explore the individual, family and social factors associated with differential trajectories.Trajectories were classified as Low (29.9-40.6%), Intermediate (52.5-58.5%) and High (6.9-12.5%) based on the symptom severity of ADHD symptoms assessed by the SNAP-IV. The proportion of children in the high ADHD trajectory might approximately reflect the prevalence of ADHD in Taiwan. The following factors differentiated High from Low trajectories: male gender, more externalizing problems, fewer prosocial behaviors, school dysfunction, more home behavioral problems, and less perceived family support.Our findings that the concurrent conditions of emotional or externalizing problems, as well as impaired school and home function at baseline, might differentiate the high ADHD symptoms trajectory from others could help developing the specific measures for managing high ADHD symptoms over time in a school setting.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-017-0165-4,
Personality Development Across Adolescence and Young Adulthood: The Role of Life Transitions and Self-Concept Clarity,"Personality develops across the lifespan, but most development occurs in adolescence and young adulthood. Life transitions to new social roles may be important drivers of mean-level personality development. The present study examined mean-level personality development in adolescence and young adulthood, and the role of the transition to tertiary education and working life therein in a sample of Dutch young people that were followed across 14 years ( N = 497, Age W1 = 13.03 years). We explored whether young people’s self-concept clarity moderated these associations. Our hypotheses and analytical plan were pre-registered. Findings from Latent Growth Models showed support for maturation in personality across adolescence and young adulthood, but not a maturity dip. Having the role of employee was associated with higher conscientiousness, but no associations were found of the transition to tertiary education and the transition to work with mean-level development of any of the personality traits. Self-concept clarity did not moderate the role of transitions in mean-level personality development. Our findings suggest that socialization effects may not explain associations between life transitions and personality development in adolescence and young adulthood.",https://doi.org/10.1177/08902070221119782,
Hair cortisol concentrations in war-affected adolescents: A prospective intervention trial,"Temporal examinations of the biological signature of stress or trauma in war-affected populations are seldom undertaken. Moreover, few studies have examined whether stress biomarkers track biological sensitivity to brief interventions targeting the improvement of psychosocial wellbeing. Our study is the first to prospectively examine, in war-affected adolescents, the associations between hair cortisol concentrations (HCC) and self-reports of stress, insecurity, posttraumatic reactions, and lifetime trauma. We conducted a randomized controlled trial to test the impact of an 8-week intervention based on profound stress attunement. We collected data for a gender-balanced sample of 733 Syrian refugee (n = 411) and Jordanian non-refugee (n = 322) adolescents (12-18 years), at three time-points. We used growth mixture models to classify cortisol trajectories, and growth models to evaluate intervention impact on stress physiology. We observed three trajectories of HCC: hypersecretion, medium secretion, and hyposecretion (9.6%, 87.5% and 2.9% of the cohort, respectively). For every one percent increase in levels of insecurity, adolescents were 0.02 times more likely to have a trajectory of hypersecretion (95% CI: 1.00, 1.03, p = 0.01). For each additional symptom of posttraumatic stress reported, they were 0.07 times less likely to show hyposecretion (95% CI: 0.89, 0.98, p = 0.01). Indeed, stronger posttraumatic stress reactions were associated with a pattern of within-individual cortisol dysregulation and medium secretion. Overall, HCC decreased by a third in response to the intervention (95% CI: -0.19, -0.03, p = 0.01). While the intervention decreased HCC for youth with hypersecretion and medium secretion, it increased HCC for youth with hyposecretion (95% CI: 0.22, 1.16, p = 0.004), relative to controls. This suggests a beneficial regularization of cortisol levels, corroborating self-reports of improved psychosocial wellbeing. We did not find evidence to suggest that gender, resilience, or posttraumatic stress disorder influenced the strength or direction of responses to the intervention. This robust impact evaluation exemplifies the utility of biomarkers for tracking physiological changes in response to interventions over time. It enhances the understanding of trajectories of endocrine response in adverse environments and patterns of stress responsivity to ecological improvement.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psyneuen.2017.12.012,
The natural history of risky drinking and associated harms from adolescence to young adulthood: findings from the Australian Temperament Project,"Background We aimed to describe the natural history of heavy episodic drinking (HED) and associated harms from adolescence to young adulthood in a large Australian population cohort study. Method The Australian Temperament Project consists of mothers and babies (4–8 months) recruited from Infant Welfare Centres and followed every 2 to 4 years until age 28 years. Analyses were based on data from 1156 young people (497 male; 659 female) surveyed repeatedly at ages 16, 18, 20, 24 and 28 years. We used dual processes latent class growth analysis to estimate trajectories of HED and associated harms, employing a piecewise approach to model the hypothesized rise and subsequent fall across adolescence and the late twenties, respectively. Results We identified four sex-specific trajectories and observed little evidence of maturing-out across the twenties. In males, a normative pattern of increasing HED across the twenties with little related harm was observed (40% of the male sample). Early and late starter groups that peaked in harms at age 20 years with only minor attenuation in binging thereafter were also observed (6.1% and 35%, respectively). In females, a normative pattern of increasing, but moderate, HED with little related harm was observed (44% of the female sample). Early and late starter groups were also identified (18% and 17%, respectively); however, unlike males, the female late starter group showed a pattern of increasing HED and related harms. Conclusions Continued patterns of risky alcohol use and related harms are apparent for both males and females across the twenties.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291717000654,
Explaining Heterogeneity of Daily Conflict Spillover in the Family: The Role of Dyadic Marital Conflict Patterns,"In this multi‐informant, longitudinal, daily diary study, we investigated whether long‐term dyadic patterns of marital conflict resolution explain the heterogeneity in short‐term day‐to‐day cross‐lagged associations between marital conflict intensity and mother–adolescent conflict intensity. The sample consisted of 419 adolescents (44.6% girls, M age = 13.02, SD = 0.44, at T1; M age = 17.02, SD = 0.44, at T5), their mothers ( N = 419, M age = 44.48, SD = 4.17, at T1), and their fathers ( N = 419, M age = 46.76, SD = 4.99, at T1). Mothers and fathers reported on their marital conflict resolution strategies annually across 5 years. Mother–father daily conflict intensity (mother‐reported) and mother–adolescent daily conflict intensity (mother‐ and adolescent‐reported) were assessed for 75 days across 5 years. We hypothesized that long‐term marital conflict resolution patterns would moderate the short‐term daily dynamics of conflict between the marital and the mother–adolescent dyads. Latent Class Growth Analysis revealed four types of families based on long‐term dyadic marital conflict resolution, including families where mostly constructive or mostly destructive conflict resolution was used. Dynamic Structural Equation Modeling was used to investigate the daily levels and short‐term daily dynamics of conflict, revealing that for most families there were no day‐to‐day lagged associations between marital conflict and mother–adolescent conflict. Results showed that long‐term conflict resolution patterns did not moderate the short‐term dynamics of daily conflict. However, differences among long‐term marital conflict resolution patterns were found in the levels of daily conflict, such that in families with long‐term destructive conflict resolution patterns, daily conflict intensity was higher.",https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12648,
Trajectories of childhood social isolation in a nationally representative cohort: Associations with antecedents and early adulthood outcomes,"Abstract Background This study examined early life antecedents of childhood social isolation, whether these factors accounted for poor outcomes of isolated children, and how these associations varied according to patterns of stability and change in childhood isolation. Methods Participants included 2232 children from the Environmental Risk (E‐Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study. We conducted growth mixture modelling (GMM) on combined parent and teacher reports of children's social isolation when children were 5, 7, 10 and 12 years, and we assessed associations with age‐5 antecedents and age‐18 outcomes using regression analyses. Results We identified three linear developmental trajectories of increasing (4.75%), decreasing (5.25%) and low stable (90.00%) social isolation. Age‐5 attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, emotional problems, prosocial behaviours, maternal personality (openness) and size of school were associated with the decreasing trajectory of social isolation. When controlling for these antecedents, increasingly isolated children were still more likely to experience ADHD symptoms, loneliness, lower job optimism and lower physical activity at age 18. Conclusions Isolated children follow distinct patterns of change over childhood and isolation seems most detrimental to health at the time it is experienced. Social isolation can be a valuable indicator of co‐occurring problems and provide targets for mental health intervention in young people.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jcv2.12073,
Intimate Partner Relationship Distress in the <scp>DSM</scp>‐5,"Over the past 40 years, a large body of literature has documented intimate partner relationship distress as a primary reason for seeking mental health services as well as an integral factor in the prognosis and treatment of a range of mental and physical health conditions. In recognition of its relevance to clinical care, the description of intimate partner relationship distress has been expanded in the DSM ‐5. Nonetheless, this is irrelevant if the DSM ‐5 code for intimate partner relationship distress is not reliably used in clinical practice and research settings. Thus, with the goal of dissemination in mind, the purpose of this paper was to provide clinicians and researchers with specific guidelines on how to reliably assess intimate partner relationship distress and how this information can be used to inform treatment planning. In addition to the implications for direct clinical care, we discuss the importance of reliable assessment and documentation of intimate partner relationship distress for future progress in epidemiology, etiology, and public health research.",https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12122,
Trajectories and correlates of opioid prescription receipt among patients experiencing interpersonal violence,"Interpersonal violence increases vulnerability to the deleterious effects of opioid use. Increased opioid prescription receipt is a major contributor to the opioid crisis; however, our understanding of prescription patterns and risk factors among those with a history of interpersonal violence remains elusive. This study sought to identify 5-year longitudinal patterns of opioid prescription receipt among patients experiencing interpersonal violence within a large healthcare system and sociodemographic and clinical characteristics associated with prescription patterns. This secondary analysis examined electronic health record data from January 2004–August 2019 for a cohort of patients (N = 1,587) referred for interpersonal violence services. Latent class growth analysis was used to estimate trajectories of opioid prescription receipt over a 5-year period. Standardized differences were calculated to assess variation in sociodemographic and clinical characteristics between classes. Our cohort had a high prevalence of prescription opioid receipt (73.3%) and underlying co-morbidities, including chronic pain (54.6%), substance use disorders (39.0%), and mental health diagnoses (76.9%). Six prescription opioid receipt classes emerged, characterized by probability of any prescription opioid receipt at the start and end of the study period (high, medium, low, never) and change in probability over time (increasing, decreasing, stable). Classes with the highest probability of prescription opioids also had the highest proportions of males, chronic pain diagnoses, substance use disorders, and mental health diagnoses. Black, non-Hispanic and Hispanic patients were more likely to be in low or no prescription opioid receipt classes. These findings highlight the importance of monitoring for synergistic co-morbidities when providing pain management and offering treatment that is trauma-informed, destigmatizing, and integrated into routine care.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0273846,
"The Role of Inhibitory Control, Attention and Vocabulary in Physical Aggression Trajectories From Infancy to Toddlerhood","Physical aggression has its origin very early in development, but no studies to date have examined physical aggression trajectories starting before the age of 1.5 years. This study examined whether cognition plays a role in the development of physical aggression from infancy onwards. In a sample of 182 mother-child dyads (94 boys; 88 girls), child physical aggression was assessed by maternal report using the Physical Aggression Scale for Early Childhood at 12, 20 and 30 months. Children performed cognitive tasks measuring inhibitory control and attention, and mothers rated children's vocabulary at 12 and 30 months. Results showed that differential development of physical aggression already starts at 12 months of age: low-stable, low-increasing, moderate-decreasing and high-stable trajectory groups were identified. Inhibitory control, attention and vocabulary at 12 months and development of these abilities from 12 to 30 months were selectively related to the likelihood of following the low-increasing and moderate-decreasing trajectories compared to the low-stable physical aggression trajectory. This study is the first to show that specific aspects of cognition and cognitive development are related to differential physical aggression development from infancy onwards.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.01079,
"Trajectories of Driving after Drinking among Marijuana-Using Youth in the Emergency Department: Substance Use, Mental Health, and Peer and Parental Influences","Background: The psychosocial correlates and longitudinal trajectories of driving after drinking (DAD) among youth remain understudied in at-risk populations. Objectives: We investigated the relationships of DAD trajectories and negative peer and parental influences, substance use, and mental health among predominantly marijuana-using youth seeking emergency department (ED) treatment. Methods: Data were from a 2-year prospective cohort study of drug-using patients (97.4% used marijuana) ages 14–24 seeking ED care for assault injury, or as part of a non-assaulted comparison group. Validated surveys measured DAD behaviors and correlates at baseline, 6, 12, 18, and 24 months. Latent class growth analysis identified characteristic DAD trajectory groups; baseline predictors were analyzed descriptively and using multinomial logistic regression. Results: Three DAD trajectory groups were identified among driving-age youth (n = 580): no DAD (NDAD; 55.2%), low-steady (LDAD; 29.0%), and high-declining (HDAD; 15.9%). In unadjusted analyses, HDAD youth were older, but otherwise similar to other groups demographically. Compared to NDAD, LDAD and HDAD group members had higher rates of drug and alcohol use disorders (p < .001). Further, HDAD group members had higher rates of anxiety symptoms and were more likely to be diagnosed with PTSD or depression than NDAD or LDAD youth (p < .05). Negative peer and parent influences were significantly higher in progressively more severe trajectory groups (p < .01). Adjusted effects from the multinomial model were analogous for peer and parental influences and substance use disorders, but not mental health. Conclusion: DAD is strongly associated with negative social influences and substance use disorders among marijuana-using youth, reinforcing their importance when developing interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10826084.2019.1660675,
Social cognition in refugee children: an experimental cross-sectional study of emotional processing with Syrian families in Turkish communities,"More than 5.6 million people have fled Syria since 2011, about half of them children. These children grow up with parents that often suffer from war-related mental health problems. In this study, we assess emotional processing abilities of 6-18 year-old children growing up in families that have fled from Syria and reside in Turkish communities (100 families, 394 individuals). We demonstrate that mothers', but not fathers', post-traumatic stress (PTS) impacts children's emotional processing abilities. A 4% reduction of mothers' PTS was equivalent to 1 year of development in children, even when controlling for parents' traumatic experiences. Making a small investment in increased mental health of refugee mothers might have a positive impact on the lives of their children.",https://doi.org/10.1098/rsos.210362,
Trajectories of Autism Symptom Severity Change During Early Childhood,"Abstract Autism symptom severity change was evaluated during early childhood in 125 children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Children were assessed at approximately 3 and 6 years of age for autism symptom severity, IQ and adaptive functioning. Each child was assigned a change score, representing the difference between ADOS Calibrated Severity Scores (CSS) at the two ages. A Decreased Severity Group (28.8%) decreased by 2 or more points; a Stable Severity Group (54.4%) changed by 1 point or less; and an Increased Severity Group (16.8%) increased by 2 or more points. Girls tended to decrease in severity more than boys and increase in severity less than boys. There was no clear relationship between intervention history and membership in the groups.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10803-020-04526-z,
"The Belfast Youth Development Study (BYDS): A prospective cohort study of the initiation, persistence and desistance of substance use from adolescence to adulthood in Northern Ireland","Background Substance misuse persists as a major public health issue worldwide with significant costs for society. The development of interventions requires methodologically sound studies to explore substance misuse causes and consequences. This Cohort description paper outlines the design of the Belfast Youth Development (BYDS), one of the largest cohort studies of its kind in the UK. The study was established to address the need for a long-term prospective cohort study to investigate the initiation, persistence and desistance of substance use, alongside life course processes in adolescence and adulthood. The paper provides an overview of BYDS as a longitudinal data source for investigating substance misuse and outlines the study measures, sample retention and characteristics. We also outline how the BYDS data have been used to date and highlight areas ripe for future work by interested researchers. Methods The study began in 2000/1 when participants (n = 3,834) were pupils in their first year of post-primary education (age 10/11 years, school year 8) from over 40 schools in Northern Ireland. Children were followed during the school years: Year 9 (in 2002; aged 12; n = 4,343), Year 10 (in 2003; aged 13; n = 4,522), Year 11 (in 2004; aged 14; n = 3,965) and Year 12 (in 2005; aged 15; n = 3,830) and on two more occasions: 2006/07 (aged 16/17; n = 2,335) and 2010/11 (aged 20/21; n = 2,087). Data were collected on substance use, family, schools, neighbourhoods, offending behaviour and mental health. The most novel aspect of the study was the collection of detailed social network data via friendship nominations allowing the investigation of the spread of substance use via friendship networks. In 2004 (school year 11; respondents aged 14), a sub-sample of participants' parents (n = 1,097) and siblings (n = 211) also completed measures on substance use and family dynamics. Results The most recent wave (in 2010/2011; respondents aged 20/21 years) indicated lifetime use of alcohol, tobacco and cannabis among the cohort was 94, 70 and 45 per cent, respectively. The paper charts the development of drug use behaviour and some of the key results to date are presented. We have also identified a number of key areas ripe for analysis by interested researchers including sexual health and education. Conclusions We have established a cohort with detailed data from adolescence to young adulthood, supplemented with parent and sibling reports and peer network data. The dataset, allowing for investigation of trajectories of adolescent substance use, associated factors and subsequent long-term outcomes, constitutes an important resource for longitudinal substance misuse research. A planned further wave as the cohort enter their late twenties and potential to link to administrative data sources, will further enrich the datasets.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0195192,
The special role of middle childhood in self‐control development: Longitudinal and genetic evidence,"Despite the importance of self-control for well-being and adjustment, its development from early childhood to early adolescence has been relatively understudied. We addressed the development of mother-reported self-control in what is likely the largest and longest longitudinal twin study of the topic to this day (N = 1889 individual children with data from at least one of five waves: ages 3, 5, 6.5, 8-9 and 11 years). We examined rank-order change in self-control from early childhood to early adolescence, genetic and environmental contributions to variance in the trait and differential developmental trajectories. The relative contribution of genetic and environmental factors to change and stability was also examined. Results point at middle childhood as a period of potential transition and change. During this period the rank-order stability of self-control increases, heritability rates substantially rise, and a cross-over occurs in two of the self-control trajectories. Nonadditive genetic effects contribute to both stability and change in self-control while the nonshared environment contributes mostly to change, with no effect for the shared environment. Our findings suggest that new genetic factors, that emerge around age 6.5 and whose effect on self-control is carried on along development, may partially account for changes in self-control around late middle childhood, and explain the growing stability in the trait approaching early adolescence. We discuss the implications of the special role of middle childhood for self-control development.",https://doi.org/10.1111/desc.13270,
Introducing the fit-criteria assessment plot – A visualisation tool to assist class enumeration in group-based trajectory modelling,"Background and objective Group-based trajectory modelling is a model-based clustering technique applied for the identification of latent patterns of temporal changes. Despite its manifold applications in clinical and health sciences, potential problems of the model selection procedure are often overlooked. The choice of the number of latent trajectories (class-enumeration), for instance, is to a large degree based on statistical criteria that are not fail-safe. Moreover, the process as a whole is not transparent. To facilitate class enumeration, we introduce a graphical summary display of several fit and model adequacy criteria, the fit-criteria assessment plot. Methods An R-code that accepts universal data input is presented. The programme condenses relevant group-based trajectory modelling output information of model fit indices in automated graphical displays. Examples based on real and simulated data are provided to illustrate, assess and validate fit-criteria assessment plot's utility. Results Fit-criteria assessment plot provides an overview of fit criteria on a single page, placing users in an informed position to make a decision. Fit-criteria assessment plot does not automatically select the most appropriate model but eases the model assessment procedure. Conclusions Fit-criteria assessment plot is an exploratory, visualisation tool that can be employed to assist decisions in the initial and decisive phase of group-based trajectory modelling analysis. Considering group-based trajectory modelling's widespread resonance in medical and epidemiological sciences, a more comprehensive, easily interpretable and transparent display of the iterative process of class enumeration may foster group-based trajectory modelling's adequate use.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0962280215598665,
Alcohol-Induced Blackouts: A Review of Recent Clinical Research with Practical Implications and Recommendations for Future Studies,"Background Alcohol-induced blackouts, or memory loss for all or portions of events that occurred during a drinking episode, are reported by approximately 50% of drinkers and are associated with a wide range of negative consequences, including injury and death. As such, identifying the factors that contribute to and result from alcohol-induced blackouts is critical in developing effective prevention programs. Here, we provide an updated review (2010 to 2015) of clinical research focused on alcohol-induced blackouts, outline practical and clinical implications, and provide recommendations for future research. Methods A comprehensive, systematic literature review was conducted to examine all articles published between January 2010 through August 2015 that focused on vulnerabilities, consequences, and possible mechanisms for alcohol-induced blackouts. Results Twenty-six studies reported on alcohol-induced blackouts. Fifteen studies examined prevalence and/or predictors of alcohol-induced blackouts. Six publications described the consequences of alcohol-induced blackouts, and 5 studies explored potential cognitive and neurobiological mechanisms underlying alcohol-induced blackouts. Conclusions Recent research on alcohol-induced blackouts suggests that individual differences, not just alcohol consumption, increase the likelihood of experiencing an alcohol-induced blackout, and the consequences of alcohol-induced blackouts extend beyond the consequences related to the drinking episode to include psychiatric symptoms and neurobiological abnormalities. Prospective studies and a standardized assessment of alcohol-induced blackouts are needed to fully characterize factors associated with alcohol-induced blackouts and to improve prevention strategies.",https://doi.org/10.1111/acer.13051,
Civic engagement and mental health trajectories in Norwegian youth,"Introduction Applying variable-centered analytical approaches, several studies have found an association between civic engagement and youth mental health. In the present study, we used a person-centered approach to explore whether civic engagement was related to optimal trajectories of mental health compared to other trajectories. We also examined how sociodemographic factors, such as socioeconomic status (SES), gender and age were related to youth mental health trajectories. Methods Our sample comprised 675 students (aged 16–22) who had participated in three waves of data collection ( M age = 18.85, SD = 0.55; 43% males) in the COMPLETE project, a cluster-randomized controlled trial that involved Norwegian upper secondary schools. Results The results revealed three trajectories of mental health (reflecting a combination of mental distress and mental well-being): optimal, intermediate, and sub-optimal. Contrary to our expectations, higher levels of civic engagement were not related to the optimal trajectory of mental health vs. other trajectories. However, we found that students who reported higher levels of SES and males were more likely to follow the optimal trajectory compared to other trajectories. Discussion While the findings on civic engagement could be due to our measurement’s inability to capture the concept of “dugnad,” a well-established civic activity in the Norwegian society, the findings regarding the influence of SES and gender suggest that there is still more work to be done concerning the assessment and advancement of factors that can address mental health inequalities across SES and gender.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpubh.2023.1214141,
Risk Factors for Gambling Disorder: A Systematic Review,"Abstract Gambling disorder is a common and problematic behavioral disorder associated with depression, substance abuse, domestic violence, bankruptcy, and high suicide rates. In the fifth edition of the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM-5), pathological gambling was renamed “gambling disorder” and moved to the Substance-Related and Addiction Disorders chapter to acknowledge that research suggests that pathological gambling and alcohol and drug addiction are related. Therefore, this paper provides a systematic review of risk factors for gambling disorder. Systematic searches of EBSCO, PubMed, and Web of Science identified 33 records that met study inclusion criteria. A revised study acknowledges as risk factors for developing/maintaining a gambling disorder being a single young male, or married for less than 5 years, living alone, having a poor education, and struggling financially.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10899-023-10195-1,
"The Role of Self-Control Dimensions, Game Motivation, Game Genre, and Game Platforms in Gaming Disorder: Cross-Sectional and Longitudinal Findings","Gaming disorder (GD) is the result of an interplay between gaming-related factors, individual factors, and environmental factors. Current research primarily highlights single types of factors. Consequently, the present study simultaneously analyzed the role of individual factors, such as self-control dimensions and motives for gaming, and gaming-related factors, such as game genres, and gaming platforms in GD among female and male gamers. Additionally, the study provides a comprehensive analysis of these factors in relation to GD both cross-sectionally (Study 1) and longitudinally (Study 2).Study 1 comprised 620 active gamers (M=22.16 years; SD=2.99), and Study 2 comprised 405 active gamers (M=28.05 years; SD=4.51). The instruments used in the studies included the Gaming Disorder Test, the nine-item Internet Gaming Disorder Short-Form (IGDS9-SF), Motives for Online Gaming Questionnaire, Video Game Questionnaire, and Self-Knowledge New Sheet.The results showed that GD was associated with (i) self-control deficits associated with difficulties in implementation control and taking actions related to goals without unnecessary delay, (ii) retaining information about intentions and long-term plans, (iii) refraining from immediate, impulsive behavior, and (iv) inhibiting emotional reactions. GD was also associated primarily with escape, coping, and competition motives for gaming. However, the longitudinal study showed that social, fantasy, and skill-development motives were also related to GD development over time. The action game genres associated with GD but were not very important for GD over time. The cross-sectional study results indicated a negative relationship between GD and tablets and consoles used as gaming platforms. However, the longitudinal study showed that desktop computers and consoles use as gaming platforms were associated with the GD over time. Moreover, gaming-related factors explained only 9% of the variance in the GD model among female gamers and only 10% of the variance in the GD model among male gamers in cross-sectional study. In contrast, individual factors such as self-control dimensions and gaming motivation explained 32% of the variance in the GD model among both female and male gamers.Individual factors, such as self-control dimensions and motives for gaming, were more important in explaining GD than gaming-related factors, such as game genres and gaming platforms. Moreover, self-control deficits and motivation related to escape, coping and competence can be important factors to consider in the prevention and treatment of GD.",https://doi.org/10.2147/prbm.s435125,
Longitudinal Development of Primary and Secondary Posttraumatic Growth in Aging Veterans and Their Wives: Domain‐Specific Trajectories,"Abstract Posttraumatic growth (PTG), the positive psychological transformations that follow traumatic events, affects both direct survivors (primary PTG) and their significant others (secondary PTG). Though primary and secondary PTG have been widely investigated in the literature, their long‐term trajectories decades after a traumatic event, especially as survivors enter older age, remain largely uninvestigated. Furthermore, it remains contested whether PTG adds up to a monolithic construct or rather consists of relatively independent components. Addressing these issues, we assessed a sample of Israeli male veterans from the 1973 Yom Kippur war ( N = 349) and their wives ( N = 156) at three time points over the course of nearly three decades. Both the veterans (primary survivors) and their wives (secondary survivors) reported PTG relating to the veterans' experiences during the war and/or captivity. Latent growth mixture modeling was conducted to identify trajectories of PTG on the five subscales of the Posttraumatic Growth Inventory. Long‐term trajectories of PTG followed heterogeneous patterns of fluctuation over time and particularly as participants entered older age. On most subscales, decreasing PTG scores were evident, a trend that was more pronounced among the primary survivors than the secondary survivors as primary and secondary PTG fluctuate considerably in the long‐term and seem to decrease as individuals enter older age. Furthermore, it would seem that PTG should not be considered a holistic concept but rather a conglomeration of positive changes. Implications of the findings are discussed within the context of limitations and potential intervening factors.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22331,
Self-control during adolescence: Examining the stability of low self-control and the effects of parental social controls,"This study examines the stability of and change in self-control during adolescence and investigates the reciprocal relationship of self-control and parental social control. German three-wave panel data with two age cohorts (11–13 and 15–17 years, total N = 1423) are analyzed. Latent growth curve and path models are applied to investigate developmental trajectories. Findings suggest (a) no evidence for the relative stability of self-control, (b) parental controls do matter after the formative years, and (c) low self-control influences the perception of parental controls in early adolescence. In sum, results support a dynamic perspective with reciprocal influences of self-control and social control.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1477370817749180,
Trajectories of team and individual sports participation in childhood and links with internalizing problems,"Abstract The purpose of this 5‐year longitudinal study is to identify trajectories of team and individual sports participation in childhood, and to compare these trajectories on different types of internalizing problems. Parents reported their children's annual sports participation from the ages of 6–10 ( n = 785) and teachers reported internalizing problems (depression, anxiety, social withdrawal) at the beginning and at the end of this period. The study used latent class growth analyses to identify two trajectories of team sports and two trajectories of individual sports participation were identified: (1) high participation, and (2) low participation. Considering baseline level of internalizing problems and gender, children in the high participation team sports trajectory show significantly fewer depression, anxiety, and social withdrawal behaviors at age 10 than those in the low participation team sports trajectory. No differences between individual sports trajectories were observed. Comparison with joint trajectory groups partially confirmed these results but also showed that sustained participation in multiple individual sports could also be linked to decreased anxiety. Our findings suggest that participation in team sports should be encouraged to promote certain aspects of children's mental health.",https://doi.org/10.1111/sode.12640,
Trajectories of nonsuicidal self‐injury during adolescence,"Although nonsuicidal self-injury is a public health concern, there is little information on how it changes across adolescence or what contributes to stability or change. We aimed to identify trajectories of stability and change in self-injury from ages 13 to 17 years, and to identify interpersonal and intrapersonal correlates that differentiate between trajectories of stability and change.We used five annual waves of cohort-sequential data, targeting 7th and 8th graders attending all public schools in three municipalities in central Sweden. The data were gathered via questionnaires, using a multi-item measure of non-suicidal self-injury and assessing negative experiences at home, in school, with peers, and in romantic settings, as well as intrapersonal issues (internalizing symptoms and difficulties with emotional, and behavioral regulation). The analytic sample was 3195 adolescents (51.7% boys, 48.3% girls; ages 12-16 years at T1, M = 13.61; SD = 0.66), most of whom were born in Sweden (88.6%) to at least one parent of Swedish origin (77.4%).Latent growth curve modeling revealed three self-injury trajectories: a stable-low, a low-increasing, and an increasing-decreasing trajectory. Adolescents in the stable-low class reported the best overall adjustment at ages 13 and 16. Comparatively, adolescents in the other two classes reported similar levels of difficulty interpersonally and intrapersonally. Where they differed, the increase-decrease class fared worse than the low-increasing class.This study suggests the need to frame self-injury as having multiple directions of development during adolescence and develop theory that aligns with differential patterns of self-injury development.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jad.12126,
Trajectories of Early Television Contact in Japan: Relationship with Preschoolers’ Externalizing Problems,"We examined the link between trajectories of television contact time at ages 1–5 and externalizing problems at age 5, using data from a Japanese longitudinal study of media use and child development (N = 1,189). Despite the American Academy of Pediatrics recommendation for no television contact before age 2, growth mixture modeling identified 3 trajectory classes, comprising heavy-start contact (8%, mean contact time at age 0 = 331.44 min/day), characterized by remarkably long television contact time in infancy and maintenance of longer contact, while mild contact (51%, 147.57 min/day) and moderate contact (41%, 236.64 min/day) had relatively shorter contact in infancy and moderate declines in later years. The findings suggest that both infant temperamental difficulties and family characteristics predicted trajectory classification of television contact time. Scores for attention problems and conduct problems at age 5 did not significantly differ among trajectory groups, nor did regression coefficients.",https://doi.org/10.1080/17482798.2015.1089298,
Personality,"With its two-tiered approach, DSM-5 is a milestone moment in the assessment of personality and psychopathology: it is the first DSM featuring a model of maladaptive personality traits and a separate measurement of levels of personality functioning.A first study examines the impact of severity of personality impairment (i.e. level of personality functioning) on interpersonal processes in daily life.A second study initiates a more developmental focus by investigating age specific and neutral expressions of personality functioning in adolescents and adults.Next, a third study derives an empirically based set of personality facets for the DSM-5 trait model, examining the direct association of the facets and specific personality disorders.A fourth study shows associations between personality traits and disorders and conceptually-relevant MMPI-2-RF scales.Finally a fifth study applies a network analytical approach to uncover causal relations between symptoms and as such reveals comorbidity patterns within the existing nosology.",https://doi.org/10.1002/ijop.12337,
The Safe pilot study: A prospective naturalistic study with repeated measures design to test the psychosis - violence link in and after discharge from forensic facilities,"The research evidence is very strong for high recidivism rates of violence after discharge from forensic facilities. Big data research has found that a substantial proportion of the forensic population with relapse into violence has a psychosis diagnosis and a criminal record. However, more research on the association between psychotic symptoms and violence may inform and enhance risk assessment, prevention, and treatment. We conducted a prospective naturalistic study with a repeated measures design in a sample of 22 psychotic patients during follow-up after discharge from forensic mental health facilities. We had three aims: to test the predictive validity of three psychotic symptom scales for violence, to analyze main and interaction effects between psychotic symptoms and previous criminal conviction, and to explore the feasibility and potential benefit of the repeated measures design for prospective follow-up research. Interpreted within the limitation of the small sample size, the results were promising for all scales, particularly for adjusted effects without interaction. Two scales remained significant when their interaction with criminal conviction was adjusted. This indicates that risk judgment of psychotic patients with criminal conviction can be improved by adding measurement of fluctuations in psychotic symptoms. The repeated measures design was instrumental in this research.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.psychres.2021.113793,
Joint trajectories of internalizing and externalizing problems in preschool children with autism spectrum disorder,Abstract The co-occurring development of internalizing and externalizing problems were examined in an inception cohort of 392 children diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder at age 3 who were assessed on four occasions. Results indicated that internalizing and externalizing problems were stable over time and highly comorbid. Joint trajectory analysis suggested that 13% of the sample followed a dual high-risk trajectory. High risk was not found to be associated with intellectual ability or autism spectrum disorder symptom severity but was linked to lower income and gender: more girls than boys were found in the high/stable internalizing problems trajectory. The results suggest that 1 in 4 preschoolers followed a trajectory of internalizing or externalizing problems (or a combination of the two) that could be characterized as clinically elevated.,https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579416000043,
The relation of home and childcare/school environment to differential trajectories of externalizing problems,"This paper uses data from the NICHD study of Early Child Care to investigate how exposure to different home and childcare/school environmental settings are associated with children’s trajectories of externalizing problem from age 2 to age 12. The sample included 1232 children (52% male). Different classes of children exhibiting low, moderate desisting, moderate, high desisting and chronic externalizing problems across the 10 year period were identified. Boys were more likely to be identified in the chronic group and girls in the low group. Furthermore, the findings suggested that the chronic externalizing problems group was also at high risk for experiencing a negative home environment across time, being born into a low familial socio-economic environment, and for experiencing a low quality classroom environment during middle childhood. Therefore, the quality of both the home and school environment are important for identifying these children at high and continuous risk for externalizing psychopathology. Finally, the findings suggested that the quality of the child’s home environment had the more pervasive consequences for the establishment and continuation of externalizing problems in comparison to the quality of the child’s childcare environment.",https://doi.org/10.54195/ijpe.18257,
Identifying environmental pathways between irritability during childhood and suicidal ideation and attempt in adolescence: findings from a 20‐year population‐based study,"Irritable children are at increased risk of suicidal ideation and suicide attempt, but the underlying environmental mechanisms accounting for these associations are largely unknown. We aimed to investigate the mediating role of peer victimization and harsh parenting in the association between childhood irritability and adolescent suicidal ideation and attempt.N = 1,483 participants from the Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development followed up from 5 months until 20 years of age (2018) with annual or biannual assessments. Irritability was operationalized using assessments of teacher-reported temper tantrums and reactive aggression. Suicidal ideation and suicide attempt at ages 13, 15, 17, and 20 years were self-reported. Peer victimization (self-reported at age 13) and harsh parenting (mothers reported at age 13) were considered as potential mediators.We identified four trajectories of teacher-reported irritability symptoms from 6 to 12 years: low (74.8%), rising (12.9%), declining (7.3%), and persistent (4.9%). In adjusted models, children in the persistent and rising trajectories had, respectively, 2.81-fold (CI, 1.27-6.22) and 2.14-fold (CI, 1.20-3.81) increased odds of suicide attempt in adolescence, but not suicidal ideation. We found that a significant proportion of the association between irritability trajectories and suicide attempt was mediated by peer victimization (33% and 35% for rising and persistent, respectively), but there was no mediation via harsh parenting.Our findings suggest that peer victimization may be a key mechanism explaining the increased suicide attempt risk of children presenting with persistently high or increasing irritability. Interventions to reduce peer victimization may be helpful to reduce suicide risk among irritable children.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.13411,
Developmental trajectories of ADHD symptoms in a large population-representative longitudinal study,"Abstract Background Previous research has suggested that there is substantial heterogeneity in the developmental trajectories of attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms. Sometimes, qualitative distinctions between trajectories with different ages of onset and/or patterns of remission are made; however, little is known about the predictors and broader clinical meaningfulness of these candidate ‘developmental subtypes’ of ADHD symptoms. Methods We applied latent class growth analysis to data from the UK Millennium Cohort Study (MCS; N = 11 316; ages 3, 5, 7, 11 and 14) to evaluate whether developmental trajectories of ADHD symptoms differing in early life predictors could be identified. Our optimal model included six trajectory groups, labelled unaffected (34.9% of the sample), mildly affected (24.1%), subclinical remitting (12.8%), pre-school onset partially remitting (14.1%), developmentally increasing (7.6%) and pre-school onset persistent (6.4%). Results Factors such as gender, conduct problems, cognitive ability, maternal education, premature birth, peer problems and school readiness scores differentiated between specific ADHD symptom trajectories. Conclusions Taken together, our findings provide preliminary evidence that distinguishing different trajectories of ADHD symptoms could be clinically informative.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0033291721000349,
"Prevalence and factors associated with trajectories of antenatal depression: a prospective multi-center cohort study in Chengdu, China","Abstract Background Antenatal depression (AD) is a major depressive disorder during pregnancy, which may lead to devastating sequelae for the expectant mothers and infants. This study aimed to investigate the prevalence, to analyze trajectory model based on EPDS score , and to explore the influence factors of AD among pregnant women in Chengdu, China. Methods Participants from four maternity hospitals in Chengdu, China were recruited when they had their first pregnancy medical check-up during March 2019 to May 2020. All participants were required to fill in Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale Chinese version (EPDS) once during three trimesters and provided information about their health status, social-demographic etc. The trajectory model, chi-square test and multivariate binary logistic regression were used to analyze all collected data. Results A total of 4560 pregnant women were recruited, while 1051 women completed the study. The prevalence of depression symptoms during the first, second and third trimesters were 32.92% (346/1051), 19.79% (208/1051) and 20.46% (215/1051) respectively. According to the results of the latent growth mixture modeling, the trajectory model of three categories based on EPDS score were identified in this study: low-risk group (38.2%, 401/1051), medium-risk group (54.8%, 576/1051) and high-risk group (7%, 74/1051). Good marital relationship ( P = 0.007, OR = 0.33, 95% CI 0.147 ~ 0.74), good relationship with parents-in-law ( P = 0.011, OR = 0.561, 95% CI 0.36 ~ 0.874), planned pregnancy ( P = 0.018, OR = 0.681, 95% CI 0.496 ~ 0.936) were the protective factors while lower education level ( P = 0.036, OR = 1.355, 95% CI 1.02 ~ 1.799), fear about dystocia ( P = 0.0, OR = 1.729, 95% CI 1.31 ~ 2.283), recent major negative life events ( P = 0.033, OR = 2.147, 95% CI 1.065 ~ 4.329) were the risk factors of medium-risk group. Good marital relationship ( P = 0.005, OR = 0.2, 95% CI 0.065 ~ 0.615), good relationship with parents-in-law ( P = 0.003, OR = 0.319, 95% CI 0.15 ~ 0.679) were also protective factors of high-risk group, but the risk factors for high-risk group were medical history ( P = 0.046, OR = 1.836, 95% CI 1.011 ~ 3.334), pregnancy complications ( P = 0.022, OR = 2.015, 95% CI 1.109 ~ 3.662), worry about dystocia ( P = 0.003, OR = 2.365, 95% CI 1.347 ~ 4.153), recent major negative life events ( P = 0.011, OR = 3.661, 95% CI 1.341 ~ 9.993). No protective or risk factors were identified for low-risk group. Conclusion Even the incidence and levels of depression in the first trimester of pregnancy were the highest, the probability of pregnancy women get depression during gestation period were higher than other population. Therefore, it’s important to monitor the psychological status of pregnant women during the whole pregnancy, especially in the first trimester. The study suggested a good partner relationship and good relations with parents-in-law both protected pregnant women from depression and promoted the well-being of mothers and children.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12884-023-05672-9,
Antiepileptic Drugs and Accumulation of Hospital Days Among Persons With Alzheimer's Disease,"To compare the accumulation of hospital days between initiators and noninitiators of antiepileptic drugs (AEDs) among persons with Alzheimer's disease (AD).Exposure-matched cohort study.Persons newly diagnosed with AD in 2005-2011 (n = 70,718) and initiating AED use identified from Finnish health care registers. For each AED initiator, 1 noninitiator matched on age, sex, and time since AD diagnosis was selected. Persons with epilepsy were excluded from the study.Association between AED initiation or use of individual AEDs and accumulation of hospital days during a 2-year follow-up was assessed using negative binomial model.AED initiators (n = 4432) were hospitalized on average for 43.7 (SD: 88.3) days and matched noninitiators for 32.2 (SD: 71.3) days during the 2-year follow-up. Altogether, 27.3% of the AED initiators and 35.6% of the noninitiators had no hospital days during the study period. Number of accumulated hospital days during the follow-up was 31% higher [adjusted incidence rate ratio (aIRR): 1.31, 95% confidence interval (CI): 1.19-1.43] among AED initiators than the noninitiators. Hospital days due to diseases of the nervous system excluding dementia (aIRR: 2.72, 95% CI: 1.72-4.31), musculoskeletal system (aIRR: 2.49, 95% CI: 1.73-3.58), respiratory system (aIRR: 1.89, 95% CI: 1.47-2.43), and mental and behavioral disorders excluding dementia (aIRR: 1.96, 95% CI: 1.02-3.79) were more common among the AED initiators than noninitiators. Among pregabalin (aIRR: 0.65, 95% CI: 0.56-0.77), gabapentin (aIRR: 0.66, 95% CI: 0.49-0.88), and clonazepam (aIRR: 0.73, 95% CI: 0.55-0.96) initiators, the number of accumulated hospital days was 27% to 35% lower than the days accumulated among the initiators of valproic acid.AED initiators had more hospital days than noninitiators. Pregabalin and gabapentin were associated with a lower number of hospital days than valproic acid. Further research is needed on the reasons for these findings.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jamda.2018.11.012,
Cumulative Effects of Growing Up in Separate and Unequal Neighborhoods on Racial Disparities in Self-rated Health in Early Adulthood,"Evidence suggests that living in a socioeconomically deprived neighborhood is associated with worse health. Yet most research relies on cross-sectional data, which implicitly ignore variation in longer-term exposure that may be more consequential for health. Using data from the 1970 to 2011 waves of the Panel Study of Income Dynamics merged with census data on respondents’ neighborhoods (N = 1,757), this study estimates a marginal structural model with inverse probability of treatment and censoring weights to examine: (1) whether cumulative exposure to neighborhood disadvantage from birth through age 17 affects self-rated health in early adulthood, and (2) the extent to which variation in such exposure helps to explain racial disparities therein. Findings reveal that prolonged exposure to neighborhood disadvantage throughout childhood and adolescence is strikingly more common among nonwhite versus white respondents and is associated with significantly greater odds of experiencing an incidence of fair or poor health in early adulthood.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0022146516671568,
The maturing moral perception of crime: The development of moral correspondence and its association with emerging adults’ delinquent involvement,"Abstract Purpose : This study scrutinizes Situational Action Theory’s (SAT) implications of how internal and external criminogenic factors concerning the rule of moral correspondence develop conjointly over the life-course and how this affects offending during emerging adulthood. Objectives : The main objective is to empirically explore whether the development of moral correspondence displays heterogeneity that can be theoretically linked to heterogeneous offending developments. Additionally, the paper also discusses unexpected co-occurrences arising specifically for the new opportunity structures to commit crimes in emerging adulthood via the broader developmental perspective proposed by the Developmental Ecological Action model of SAT (DEA). Methods : Results from two separate classification models (latent class growth analysis and repeated-measurement latent class analysis) following a German non-offender sample’s (N = 1810) transition between adolescence and emerging adulthood (ages 14 to 28) are cross-tabulated. Results : Five moral correspondence pathways differentiated by the timing, speed and completeness of achieving pro-social states can be extracted. The longer individuals resist this maturitation process during adolescence, the higher their chances are to follow a trajectory during emerging adulthood characterized by proclivities for youth crimes. However, these also follow a diminishing trend. Contrary, rising trajectories fueled by proclivities to commit adult crimes are less often associated by a remiss to maturity. Social selection into specific activity fields seems to play an important role in the availability and accessibility to either type of crime, thus, offering an explanation for these diverging results. Conclusion : SAT and its developmental framework DEA serve as useful blueprints to map the development of changes in crime and its related causes even with non-situational data through its analytical rigor to integrate micro-, meso-, and macro-levels of explanation.",https://doi.org/10.1515/mks-2021-0104,
"The developmental course of loneliness in adolescence: Implications for mental health, educational attainment, and psychosocial functioning","Abstract The present study examined patterns of stability and change in loneliness across adolescence. Data were drawn from the Environmental Risk (E-Risk) Longitudinal Twin Study, a UK population-representative cohort of 2,232 individuals born in 1994 and 1995. Loneliness was assessed when participants were aged 12 and 18. Loneliness showed modest stability across these ages ( r = .25). Behavioral genetic modeling indicated that stability in loneliness was explained largely by genetic influences (66%), while change was explained by nonshared environmental effects (58%). Individuals who reported loneliness at both ages were broadly similar to individuals who only reported it at age 18, with both groups at elevated risk of mental health problems, physical health risk behaviors, and education and employment difficulties. Individuals who were lonely only at age 12 generally fared better; however, they were still more likely to finish school with lower qualifications. Positive family influences in childhood predicted reduced risk of loneliness at age 12, while negative peer experiences increased the risk. Together, the findings show that while early adolescent loneliness does not appear to exert a cumulative burden when it persists, it is nonetheless a risk for a range of concomitant impairments, some of which can endure.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579421001632,
"Trajectories of psychosocial symptoms and wellbeing in asylum seekers and refugees exposed to traumatic events and resettled in Western Europe, Turkey, and Uganda","Background: Longitudinal studies examining mental health trajectories in refugees and asylum seekers are scarce. Objectives: To investigate trajectories of psychological symptoms and wellbeing in refugees and asylum seekers, and identify factors associated with these trajectories. Method: 912 asylum seekers and refugees from the control arm of three trials in Europe (n = 229), Turkey (n = 320), and Uganda (n = 363) were included. We described trajectories of psychological symptoms and wellbeing, and used trauma exposure, age, marital status, education, and individual trial as predictors. Then, we assessed the bidirectional interactions between wellbeing and psychological symptoms, and the effect of each predictor on each outcome controlling for baseline values. Results: Symptom improvement was identified in all trials, and for wellbeing in 64.7% of participants in Europe and Turkey, versus 31.5% in Uganda. In Europe and Turkey domestic violence predicted increased symptoms at post-intervention (ß = 1.36, 95% CI 0.17-2.56), whilst murder of family members at 6-month follow-up (ß = 1.23, 95% CI 0.27-2.19). Lower wellbeing was predicted by murder of family member (ß = -1.69, 95% CI -3.06 to -0.32), having been kidnapped (ß = -1.67, 95% CI -3.19 to -0.15), close to death (ß = -1.38, 95% CI -2.70 to -0.06), and being in the host country ≥2 years (ß = -1.60, 95% CI -3.05 to -0.14). In Uganda at post-intervention, having been kidnapped predicted increased symptoms (ß = 2.11, 95% CI 0.58-3.65), and lack of shelter (ß = -2.51, 95% CI -4.44 to -0.58) and domestic violence predicted lower wellbeing (ß = -1.36, 95% CI -2.67 to -0.05). Conclusion: Many participants adapt to adversity, but contextual factors play a critical role in determining mental health trajectories.",https://doi.org/10.1080/20008066.2022.2128270,
"Trajectories of PTSD Among Lower Manhattan Residents and Area Workers Following the 2001 World Trade Center Disaster, 2003–2012","Abstract Group‐based trajectory modeling was used to explore empirical trajectories of symptoms of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) among 17,062 adult area residents/workers (nonrescue/recovery workers) enrolled in the World Trade Center (WTC) Health Registry using 3 administrations of the PTSD Checklist (PCL) over 9 years of observation. Six trajectories described PTSD over time: low‐stable (48.9%), moderate‐stable (28.3%), moderate‐increasing (8.2%), high‐stable (6.0%), high‐decreasing (6.6 %), and very high‐stable (2.0%). To examine factors associated with improving or worsening PTSD symptoms, groups with similar intercepts, but different trajectories were compared using bivariate analyses and logistic regression. The adjusted odds of being in the moderate‐increasing relative to the moderate‐stable group were significantly greater among enrollees reporting low social integration ( OR = 2.18), WTC exposures (range = 1.34 to 1.53), job loss related to the September 11, 2001 disaster ( OR = 1.41), or unmet mental health need/treatment ( OR = 4.37). The odds of being in the high‐stable relative to the high‐decreasing group were significantly greater among enrollees reporting low social integration ( OR = 2.23), WTC exposures (range = 1.39 to 1.45), or unmet mental health need/treatment ( OR = 3.42). The influence of severe exposures, scarce personal/financial resources, and treatment barriers on PTSD trajectories suggest a need for early and ongoing PTSD screening postdisaster.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22090,
Is the Development of Family Functioning Dependent on Trajectories of Antisocial Behavior? A TRAILS Study,"Abstract Where previous studies have found consistent links between family factors and antisocial behavior, it is important to examine this relationship from a developmental perspective and account for heterogeneous antisocial development. In the present study, our goal was twofold: (1) identify and examine trajectories of self-reported antisocial behavior, and (2) compare the intercepts and slopes of family functioning of adolescents with different trajectories of antisocial behavior. We used a large national representative sample of 2230 Dutch boys and girls who we followed from approximately 10 to 22 years. We applied Latent class growth modeling to identify antisocial trajectories for boys and girls separately, across which the intercepts and slopes of family functioning were compared. We found four antisocial trajectories for boys and three antisocial trajectories for girls, which mostly corresponded with the trajectories found in previous literature. Further, we found that family functioning did not differ as a function of membership to a particular trajectory of antisocial behavior, neither on baseline measures nor on changes of family functioning across adolescence. Within this specific sample of adolescents, these results suggest that family functioning, as perceived by parents, remain stable regardless of antisocial behavior. Future research, in addition to using general family functioning measures, should also examine day-to-day family interactions, preferably also accounting for the perspective of the adolescent.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s10826-020-01758-6,
Longitudinal Protective Factors against Intimate Partner Violence for Women Born in Australia and Women from Refugee Backgrounds,"Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) is a risk factor for depressive disorders and other harms to women and their pregnancy. There is a need for longitudinal evidence to assist with understanding the subgroups of women including those from refugee background affected by IPV. We recruited women at their prenatal visit from three antenatal clinics in Australia (January 2015–March 2016). A total of 1335 women, 650 (48.7%) born in Australia and 685 (51.3%) from refugee backgrounds, completed baseline assessment; then, Time 2 follow-up was at 6 months and Time 3 follow-up was at 24 months post birth. The WHO Intimate Partner Violence (IPV) measure was used. Latent class growth analysis grouped individuals based on trajectories of IPV across three time points. A three-step process identified characteristics associated with respective latent class membership. Similar three-class solutions were observed across both cohorts, composed of Limited IPV (64% and 48% Australian-born and refugee background, respectively); Changing IPV (31%; 46%)—various combinations of IPV categories across time; Combined IPV (4%; 6%)—IPV at all time points, all transitioning to the combined physical and psychological abuse category at Time 3. Older age, fewer children, being in a couple, having a better partner, family and friend relationships, fewer partner trauma events, and fewer living difficulties emerged as protective factors for the changing and combined categories, with a distinct pattern for the refugee cohort. The findings assist with understanding and defining of the highest risk group for targeting interventions to prevent IPV, and the unique protective factors across the two IPV-affected classes for women born in Australia and those who arrived as refugees.",https://doi.org/10.3390/women4030024,
"Trajectories of self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness during the COVID-19 pandemic: A person-oriented multi-trajectory approach","The COVID-19 pandemic has produced unprecedented changes in the lives of many people. Although research has documented associations between concerns related to COVID-19 and poor mental health indicators, fewer studies have focused on positive factors that could help people better cope with this stressful social context. To fill this gap, the present research investigated the trajectories of self-compassion facets in times of dramatic social change. Using a longitudinal research design, we described the trajectories of self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness during the first eight months of the COVID-19 pandemic, in a representative sample of Canadian adults (N = 3617). Relying on a multi-trajectory group-based approach, we identified clusters of individuals following persistently low (4.0%), moderate-low (39.3%), moderate-high (46.7%), and high (10.0%) levels of self-kindness, common humanity, and mindfulness. Interestingly, we found that compassionate self-responding trajectories were mainly stable over time with minor fluctuations for some groups of individuals, in line with the epidemiological situation. In terms of covariates, we observed that older women were more likely to follow trajectories of high compassionate self-responding, as compared to the other age and gender groups. In terms of mental health indicators, we demonstrated that trajectory groups with high levels of compassionate self-responding were associated with greater life satisfaction, more happiness, better sleep quality, higher sleep quantity, and fewer negative emotions, as compared to lower trajectory groups. The results supported the idea that self-compassion during the COVID-19 pandemic could have favored better mental health indicators and could possibly be promoted as a psychological intervention in the general population.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0292522,

The Childhood Echo: How Romantic Biographies Reflect Early Life Events and Abilities,"Objective This study examines how childhood experiences predicts the development of romantic relationship trajectories in adulthood and whether individual characteristics moderates the association. We were especially interested in whether childhood experiences and individual resources augmented or compensated each other with regard to relationship trajectories.Background Childhood experiences and socio-cognitive capabilities are associated with a variety of adult outcomes. In particular, previous research suggests that childhood health, residential instability, physical violence, parental absence, and relationships with parents, in addition to academic and social skills, could also be linked to the formation of romantic relationship trajectories, in ways that might vary by gender.Method Drawing upon retrospective interviews from the Survey of Health Ageing, and Retirement in Europe (N=26 469), we assessed how these childhood factors predicted different relationship trajectories of men and women with confirmatory factor analysis and multinomial logistic regression. To construct relationship trajectories between ages 15–50, we employed latent class growth modeling.Results Individuals with positive childhood experiences were more likely to form stable first marriages. Negative childhood experiences were associated with a higher likelihood of having other types of relationship trajectories for both sexes. The probability of arriving at different relationship trajectories by childhood experiences varied less for women with high socio-cognitive capabilities.Conclusion Romantic biographies reflect early life events. The findings partly support resource substitution theory, suggesting that women with high socio-cognitive capabilities are less susceptible to both positive and negative childhood experiences.",https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/3v2ys,
Trajectories of Treatment Response in Hallucinations,"Objective Hallucinations are highly prevalent in schizophrenia and related disorders. Antipsychotics are generally effective in treating hallucinations, but major inter-individual differences in treatment response exist. Previous studies have identified heterogeneity of over-all antipsychotic response patterns in schizophrenia. The aim of this study was to explore the heterogeneity in the response of hallucinations to antipsychotic drug treatment in a representative sample of patients acutely admitted for psychosis. Methods 226 adult patients with symptoms of active psychosis were included in a randomized pragmatic trial of second-generation antipsychotics and followed for 27 weeks. Latent-mixture and latent growth curve models were conducted to analyze heterogeneity of treatment response for hallucinations to second-generation antipsychotics. Results We found five different trajectories of treatment response for patients with hallucinations at baseline. These included two groups of “dramatic responders” who had rapid reduction followed by extinction of hallucinations during the first four weeks of treatment, then groups of “gradual responders”, “temporal responders” and “non-responders”. Most responders, 80% of those with hallucinations at baseline, were dramatic responders. Patients who showed no response in the early weeks remained non-responders also after longer follow-up. Conclusions The study suggests the existence of differential response patterns of hallucinations to antipsychotic treatment, and that a significant subgroup are dramatic responders. Hallucinations generally respond quickly to antipsychotic treatment. With no improvement in the very first weeks an early change of treatment should be considered.",https://doi.org/10.4172/neuropsychiatry.1000564,
Childhood peer network characteristics: genetic influences and links with early mental health trajectories,"Background Peer relationships are important for children's mental health, yet little is known of their etiological underpinnings. Here, we explore the genetic influences on childhood peer network characteristics in three different networks defined by rejection, acceptance, and prosocial behavior. We further examine the impact of early externalizing and internalizing trajectories on these same peer network characteristics. Methods Participants were 1,288 children from the Dutch ‘Generation R’ birth cohort. At age 7, we mapped out children's classroom peer networks for peer rejection, acceptance, and prosocial behavior using mutual peer nominations. In each network, genetic influences were estimated for children's degree centrality, closeness centrality and link reciprocity from DNA using Genome‐wide Complex Trait Analysis. Preschool externalizing and internalizing trajectories were computed using parental ratings at ages 1.5, 3, and 5 years. Results Of the three network properties examined, closeness centrality emerged as significantly heritable across all networks. Preschool externalizing problems predicted unfavorable positions within peer rejection networks and having fewer mutual friendships. In contrast, children with preschool‐internalizing problems were not actively rejected by their peers, but were less well‐connected within their social support network. Conclusions Our finding of significant heritability for closeness centrality should be taken as preliminary evidence that requires replication. Nevertheless, it can orient us to the role of genes in shaping a child's position within peer networks. Additionally, social network perspectives offer rich insights into how early life mental health trajectories impact a child's later functioning within peer networks.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jcpp.12493,
What Do We Know about the Long-Term Course of Early Onset Bipolar Disorder? A Review of the Current Evidence,"Aim: Early onset of psychopathology is often an index of a more severe clinical course and worse prognosis. This review examined the course of bipolar disorder (BD) with onset in childhood and adolescence, with a focus on persistence of symptoms, severity of illness, comorbidity, and functional impairment. Methods: The databases of PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo were systematically searched for publications since 1990 reporting on long-term (12 months or longer) assessments of patients with early onset BD. Results: Forty-two relevant publications were identified, which reported on data derived from 15 different patient cohorts, including 7 prospective research psychopathology studies, 4 medical record reviews, 2 follow-ups of clinical trial samples, 1 managed care database, and 1 nationwide registry, for a total of 10,187 patients. The length of follow-ups ranged from 1.0 to 15 years. Diagnostic stability of BD ranged from 73% to 100% over ten years. Recovery rate from an index episode was 81.5–100% and recurrence rate was 35–67%. Suicide attempt cumulative prevalence in five years was 18–20%. Earlier age at the first episode predicted a more severe clinical course. Conclusions: Early onset BD persists over time through adolescence, with homotypic diagnostic continuity over the years, but heterogeneity in the severity of the clinical course. Whether early identification and treatment improves distal prognosis remains to be further investigated.",https://doi.org/10.3390/brainsci11030341,
Prediction of stress and drug craving ninety minutes in the future with passively collected GPS data,"Abstract Just-in-time adaptive interventions (JITAIs), typically smartphone apps, learn to deliver therapeutic content when users need it. The challenge is to “push” content at algorithmically chosen moments without making users trigger it with effortful input. We trained a randomForest algorithm to predict heroin craving, cocaine craving, or stress (reported via smartphone app 3x/day) 90 min into the future, using 16 weeks of field data from 189 outpatients being treated for opioid-use disorder. We used only one form of continuous input (along with person-level demographic data), collected passively: an indicator of environmental exposures along the past 5 h of movement, as assessed by GPS. Our models achieved excellent overall accuracy—as high as 0.93 by the end of 16 weeks of tailoring—but this was driven mostly by correct predictions of absence. For predictions of presence, “believability” (positive predictive value, PPV) usually peaked in the high 0.70s toward the end of the 16 weeks. When the prediction target was more rare, PPV was lower. Our findings complement those of other investigators who use machine learning with more broadly based “digital phenotyping” inputs to predict or detect mental and behavioral events. When target events are comparatively subtle, like stress or drug craving, accurate detection or prediction probably needs effortful input from users, not passive monitoring alone. We discuss ways in which accuracy is difficult to achieve or even assess, and warn that high overall accuracy (including high specificity) can mask the abundance of false alarms that low PPV reveals.",https://doi.org/10.1038/s41746-020-0234-6,
Bullying Perpetration and Narcissistic Personality Traits across Adolescence: Joint Trajectories and Childhood Risk Factors,"Objectives: Although there is some evidence on the longitudinal associations between bullying perpetration and narcissistic personality traits, their joint developmental trajectories across early to late adolescence are largely unknown. Accordingly, we examined the co-development of bullying perpetration and narcissistic personality traits across adolescence and examined the childhood predictors of these joint trajectories. Method: Self-reports of bullying and narcissistic personality traits were assessed across six years of adolescence from Grade 7 (i.e., age 13) to Grade 12 (i.e., age 18) in a sample of 616 Canadian adolescents and childhood predictors were assessed in Grades 5 and 6. Results: As predicted, latent class growth analyses demonstrated that most adolescents were reflected in a trajectory of low decreasing bullying (82.0%) and a smaller group followed a moderate stable trajectory of bullying (18.0%). The majority of adolescents followed a moderate stable trajectory of narcissistic traits (56.3%), followed by a high increasing trajectory of narcissistic traits (22.8%), and a low decreasing trajectory of narcissistic traits (20.9%). Six percent of adolescents followed a high-risk dual trajectory of moderate stable bullying and high increasing narcissistic traits (high-risk group). Also as predicted, higher hyperactivity, higher frustration, and lower anxiety in childhood differentiated the high-risk group from a low-risk group (low decreasing bullying and low decreasing narcissistic traits; 19.0%). Higher childhood hyperactivity also differentiated a group of adolescents who followed a trajectory of moderate stable bullying and moderate stable narcissistic traits (10.0%) from the low-risk group. Results showed that moderate stable bullying was a better indicator of high increasing and moderate stable trajectories of narcissistic personality traits than the reverse. Conclusions: Findings suggest adolescence is a time when personality and bullying reflect dynamic and heterogeneous development. Early intervention of childhood risk factors may help prevent a high-risk developmental course of bullying and narcissistic personality traits across adolescence.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyt.2020.483229,
Current understanding of fear learning and memory in humans and animal models and the value of a linguistic approach for analyzing fear learning and memory in humans,"Fear is an emotion that serves as a driving factor in how organisms move through the world. In this review, we discuss the current understandings of the subjective experience of fear and the related biological processes involved in fear learning and memory. We first provide an overview of fear learning and memory in humans and animal models, encompassing the neurocircuitry and molecular mechanisms, the influence of genetic and environmental factors, and how fear learning paradigms have contributed to treatments for fear-related disorders, such as posttraumatic stress disorder. Current treatments as well as novel strategies, such as targeting the perisynaptic environment and use of virtual reality, are addressed. We review research on the subjective experience of fear and the role of autobiographical memory in fear-related disorders. We also discuss the gaps in our understanding of fear learning and memory, and the degree of consensus in the field. Lastly, the development of linguistic tools for assessments and treatment of fear learning and memory disorders is discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.neubiorev.2019.03.015,
Early emotional and communication functioning predicting the academic trajectories of refugee children in Canada,"We examined how emotional and communication functioning at kindergarten predicted the academic trajectories of refugee children. Drawing from a population-based Canadian cohort, the study followed 629 refugee children from age 5 to 13 and (i) modeled kindergarten, Grade 4, and Grade 7 academic trajectories via group-based trajectory modeling and (ii) investigated to what extent teacher ratings of kindergarten emotional and communication functioning predicted academic trajectory group membership. Three groups were identified: ‘Average’ (n = 438), ‘Declining’ (n = 119), and ‘Low-But-Improving’ (n = 72) groups. Logistic regression analyses revealed that, in comparison to the Average trajectory, lower emotional functioning at kindergarten was associated with an increased likelihood of a Declining academic trajectory, whereas lower communication functioning at kindergarten was associated with a greater likelihood of a Low-But-Improving trajectory (versus an Average trajectory). The findings indicate that refugee children are more likely to overcome early communication challenges versus emotional challenges to achieve academically, and this has important implications for early mental health support.",https://doi.org/10.1080/01443410.2018.1475627,
"C-reactive protein, Epstein-Barr virus, and cortisol trajectories in refugee and non-refugee youth: Links with stress, mental health, and cognitive function during a randomized controlled trial","Experiencing childhood adversity has been associated with significant changes in inflammation, cell-mediated immunocompetence, and cortisol secretion. Relatively few studies have examined, longitudinally, alterations to inflammatory processes during adolescence, especially outside Western contexts; none have evaluated biomarker trajectories for at-risk youth in response to a structured behavioral intervention. We conducted a randomized controlled trial evaluating the efficacy of a humanitarian intervention targeting stress-alleviation, with 12-18 year-old Syrian refugees (n = 446) and Jordanian non-refugees (n = 371) living side-by-side in war-affected communities in Jordan. We measured C-reactive protein (CRP), Epstein-Barr virus antibodies (EBV), and hair cortisol concentration (HCC) at three timepoints (pre/post intervention and 11 month follow-up), and assessed three main outcomes (psychosocial stress, mental health, and cognitive function). Using growth mixture models, regressions, and growth curve models, we identified three distinct trajectories for CRP, two for EBV, and three for HCC, and examined their associations with age, gender, BMI, poverty, and trauma. We found associations with BMI for CRP, refugee status for EBV, and BMI and gender with HCC trajectory. In terms of health outcomes, we found associations between rising CRP levels and perceived stress (B = -2.92, p = .007), and between HCC hypersecretion and insecurity (B = 7.21, p = .017). In terms of responses to the intervention, we observed no differential impacts by CRP or EBV trajectories, unlike HCC. These results suggest that commonly-assayed biomarkers do not associate with health outcomes and respond to targeted interventions in straightforward ways. Our study is the first to examine multiple biomarker trajectories in war-affected adolescents, in order to better evaluate the extent, timing, and malleability of the biological signatures of poverty, conflict, and forced displacement.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bbi.2019.02.015,
Trajectories of Health-Related Quality of Life Among Children With Newly Diagnosed Epilepsy,"Objective To identify two-year trajectories of health-related quality of life (HRQOL) among children with newly diagnosed epilepsy, and evaluate key predictors of HRQOL trajectories. Methods This study is part of a prospective study of adherence and HRQOL outcomes in children with epilepsy. Caregivers completed an HRQOL questionnaire at one month post diagnosis and every three months thereafter for two years. Chart review and additional questionnaires were used to collect medical variables and seizure outcomes. Results Participants included 120 children with epilepsy and their caregiver. Unique trajectories for overall HRQOL and PedsQL™ subscales were identified and were predominantly stable. A total side effects score emerged as a consistent predictor of all HRQOL domains. Other variables (i.e., socioeconomic status, seizures, internalizing and externalizing problems) uniquely predicted HRQOL domains. Conclusions Medical and psychosocial interventions should be implemented soon after treatment initiation to target modifiable factors (e.g., side effects, anxiety symptoms), which could improve HRQOL.",https://doi.org/10.1093/jpepsy/jsw019,
Changes in tourist arrivals in Tuscan destinations between 2000 and 2013: A group based trajectory approach,"The aim of this paper is to examine the development of tourism in Tuscany’s municipalities, using a methodology to detect common growth curves from yearly time series (2000-2013) of the number of arrivals. The analysis is based on a partition of Tuscany into 262 areas derived from a partial aggregation of the original 287 municipalities. The work is carried out by finding a criterion to detect common time patterns of arrivals across territories, classifying territories according to such similarities in patterns, and verifying whether areas in the same group are also spatially contiguous. The study confirms the presence of heterogeneity in the growth patterns of different areal units. There is a general stability of the classical tourism destinations which are renowned worldwide. Other destinations have been developing due to exploiting the demand for rural tourism, interest in nature, environment and landscape, and so on. The growth patterns are derived by means of a special approach of finite mixture modelling: the group based trajectory model, a semiparametric method that aims to detect common patterns in longitudinal data.",https://doi.org/10.54055/ejtr.v14i.242,
Variation in marital quality in a national sample of divorced women.,"Previous work has compared marital quality between stably married and divorced individuals. Less work has examined the possibility of variation among divorcés in trajectories of marital quality as divorce approaches. This study addressed that hole by first examining whether distinct trajectories of marital quality can be discerned among women whose marriages ended in divorce and, second, the profile of women who experienced each trajectory. Latent class growth analyses with longitudinal data from a nationally representative sample were used to ""look backward"" from the time of divorce. Although demographic and socioeconomic variables from this national sample did not predict the trajectories well, nearly 66% of divorced women reported relatively high levels of both happiness and communication and either low or moderate levels of conflict. Future research including personality or interactional patterns may lead to theoretical insights about patterns of marital quality in the years leading to divorce.",https://doi.org/10.1037/fam0000082,
Pathways to self-sufficiency in the microfinance ecosystem,"We used latent class growth analysis to study the trajectories followed by microfinance institutions for 10 years. This technique can detect groups of firms that follow different patterns of change over time. We identified groups of institutions that followed the same strategy and iso-performance groups of institutions with the same outcome trajectory. The trajectories were analyzed with categorical regression and decision trees, which constitutes a novel approach to latent class growth analysis. Lending money to the poorest while making a profit is not straightforward and it is challenging for microfinance institutions to be self-sufficient. We found that the most useful strategy was to improve efficiency by lowering operating costs, followed by the control of credit risk. Deviating from the mission also had a positive effect on self-sufficiency, but was a strategy followed by few institutions. Rarely did changes in interest rates or not lending to women prove valuable. The findings are useful for the stakeholders of these institutions and particularly for managers.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.qref.2023.10.007,
A Cluster Randomized Trial of Promoting Alternative Thinking Strategies (PATHS®) With Swedish Preschool Children,"The preschool edition of Promoting Alternative THinking Strategies (PATHS ® ) is a school-based, teacher implemented universal intervention developed in the United States designed to promote social emotional competence (SEC) in children as a foundation for improved mental health. PATHS is delivered as a curriculum and it is based on theories and research regarding SEC, brain development, and optimal school environments. A majority of children in Sweden attend preschool, which is government-subsidized and follows a national curriculum focusing on both academic and social emotional learning. However, there is not so much focus on formal instruction nor manual-based lessons. The purpose of this study was to assess the short-term (pre- to post-test) effects of PATHS in the Swedish preschool setting. Using a two-wave cluster randomized trial with multi-method and informant assessment ( N = 285 4 and 5-year-old Swedish children; n = 145 wait-list control; n = 140 intervention; K = 26 preschools; k = 13 intervention; k = 13 control) we assessed changes in child emotional knowledge, emotional awareness, social problem solving, prosocial play, inhibitory control, and working memory using structural equation modeling (SEM). We included schools with at least one classroom of 4–5-year-old children from three municipalities. We excluded open preschools, parent cooperative preschools, and family day homes. After random assignment, schools were informed of condition assignment. Research team members were not blind to assignment. We hypothesized that relative to children in control schools, children in intervention schools would evidence improvements in social emotional competence as well as other outcomes. Children in PATHS, relative to children in the control, evidenced improvements in working memory and prosocial play, but also showed an increase in hyperactive behaviors. Girls in PATHS, relative to girls in the control, showed improvement in emotional knowledge and reduced anxiety. These results are considered in light of efforts to promote positive development and mental health. The trial registration number at ClinicalTrials.gov is NCT04512157. Main funding was from Swedish Council for Working Life and Social Research, the Swedish Research Council, Formas, and VINNOVA (dnr: 259-2012-71).",https://doi.org/10.3389/fpsyg.2021.695288,
Self‐Regulation Shift Theory: A Dynamic Systems Approach to Traumatic Stress,"Self‐regulation shift theory (SRST) is a threshold theory explaining self‐regulation following trauma that utilizes nonlinear dynamics to capture systemic shifts in trauma adaptation. Cusp catastrophe modeling tests nonlinear changes in an outcome (e.g., posttraumatic distress) based on an identified bifurcation factor under specific conditions (i.e., asymmetry variables). We evaluated two cusp models in a motor vehicle accident (MVA) database and then confirmed findings within a similar dataset. Based on SRST, we tested coping self‐efficacy (CSE) as the bifurcation factor and a set of asymmetry controlling variables. Results demonstrated significant cusp models with CSE as a consistent bifurcation factor in all models. When participants reported lower peritraumatic dissociation, early lower CSE was a significant bifurcation factor for 3‐month trauma symptoms in Sample 1, R 2 = .18. The cusp model for changes in symptoms from 30 days to 3 months showed CSE as a significant bifurcation variable with higher levels of avoidant coping ( R 2 = .27). In a separate sample, early lower CSE was again a significant bifurcation variable with lower injury severity ( R 2 = .52). Results support the importance of self‐regulatory appraisals in nonlinear shifts in posttraumatic stress symptoms 3 months post‐MVA. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22208,
Resilience and Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Symptoms in National Guard Soldiers Deployed to Iraq: A Prospective Study of Latent Class Trajectories and Their Predictors,"This study examined the prospective course of posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms in a cohort of National Guard soldiers ( N = 522) deployed to combat operations in Iraq. Participants were assessed 4 times: 1 month before deployment, 2–3 months after returning from deployment, 1 year later, and 2 years postdeployment. Growth mixture modeling revealed 3 distinct trajectories: low‐stable symptoms, resilient, 76.4%; new‐onset symptoms, 14.2%; and chronic distress, 9.4%. Relative to the resilient class, membership in both the new‐onset symptoms and chronic distress trajectory classes was predicted by negative emotionality/neuroticism, odds ratios ( OR s) = 1.09, 95% CI [1.02, 1.17], and OR = 1.22, 95% CI [1.09,1.35], respectively; and combat exposure, OR = 1.07, 95% CI [1.02, 1.12], and OR = 1.12, 95% CI [1.02, 1.24], respectively. Membership in the new‐onset trajectory class was predicted by predeployment military preparedness, OR = 0.95, 95% CI [0.91, 0.98], perceived threat during deployment, OR = 1.07, 95% CI [1.03, 1.10], and stressful life events following deployment, OR = 1.44, 95% CI [1.05, 1.96]. Prior deployment to Iraq or Afghanistan, OR = 3.85, 95% CI [1.72, 8.69], predeployment depression, OR = 1.27, 95% CI [1.20, 1.36], and predeployment concerns about a deployment's impact on civilian/family life, OR = 1.09, 95% CI [1.02, 1.16], distinguished the chronic distress group relative to the resilient group. Identifying predeployment vulnerability and postdeployment contextual factors provides insight for future efforts to bolster resilience, prevent, and treat posttraumatic symptoms.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22199,
Trajectories of Resting Heart Period and Shyness in Adolescent Females Exposed to Child Maltreatment,"Relatively little is known about the psychophysiological processes underlying the development of socioemotional vulnerabilities that are common among adolescents exposed to child maltreatment. Using a prospective, longitudinal design, we investigated whether trajectories of resting heart period (HP; a physiological correlate of stress vulnerability) across three visits (separated by 6 months) was associated with shyness (a type of socioemotional vulnerability) in adolescent females exposed to child maltreatment ( N = 55; M age = 14.07 years). Adolescents’ resting HP across visits was best characterized by two latent trajectories: a stable high class (25.5%) and a stable low class (74.5%). The stable low HP trajectory was associated with higher shyness at Time 1 (T1), and HP trajectory moderated the association between T1 and Time 3 (T3) shyness. Females in the stable low HP trajectory demonstrated stability of shyness from T1 to T3, whereas T1 and T3 shyness were unrelated for females in the stable high HP trajectory. We also found that shyness at T1 and T3 was associated with greater levels of anxiety at T3. These findings illustrate heterogeneity in the developmental patterns of resting autonomic activity in adolescent females exposed to child maltreatment; such differences may influence the continuity of some traits linked with socioemotional vulnerability such as shyness.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1077559518818373,
Scoping review on trauma and recovery in youth after natural disasters: what Europe can learn from natural disasters around the world,"In the last decade, Europe has seen a rise in natural disasters. Due to climate change, an increase of such events is predicted for the future. While natural disasters have been a rare phenomenon in Europe so far, other regions of the world, such as Central and North America or Southeast Asia, have regularly been affected by Hurricanes and Tsunamis. The aim of the current study is to synthesize the literature on child development in immediate stress, prolonged reactions, trauma, and recovery after natural disasters with a special focus on trajectories of (mal-)adaptation. In a literature search using PubMed, Psychinfo and EBSCOhost, 15 studies reporting about 11 independent samples, including 11,519 participants aged 3-18 years, were identified. All studies identified resilience, recovery, and chronic trajectories. There was also evidence for delayed or relapsing trajectories. The proportions of participants within each trajectory varied across studies, but the more favorable trajectories such as resilient or recovering trajectory were the most prevalent. The results suggested a more dynamic development within the first 12 months post-disaster. Female gender, a higher trauma exposure, more life events, less social support, and negative coping emerged as risk factors. Based on the results, a stepped care approach seems useful for the treatment of victims of natural disasters. This may support victims in their recovery and strengthen their resilience. As mental health responses to disasters vary, a coordinated screening process is necessary, to plan interventions and to detect delayed or chronic trauma responses and initiate effective interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s00787-022-01983-y,
Trajectories of Handgun Carrying in Rural Communities From Early Adolescence to Young Adulthood,"<h3>Importance</h3> Characterizing patterns of handgun carrying among adolescents and young adults can inform programs to reduce firearm-related harm. Longitudinal patterns of handgun carrying among rural adolescents have not been identified. <h3>Objectives</h3> To assess specific points of intervention by characterizing patterns of handgun carrying by youths in rural communities from early adolescence to young adulthood and to quantify how age at initiation, duration, and frequency of carrying differ across identified patterns. <h3>Design, Setting, and Participants</h3> This cohort study uses the control group of the community-randomized trial of the Communities That Care prevention system, conducted among public school students in 12 rural communities across 7 states. Participants self-reported their handgun carrying at 10 data collection points from 12 to 26 years of age (2005-2019). Data were analyzed from January to July 2021. <h3>Main Outcomes and Measures</h3> Handgun carrying in the past 12 months. Latent class growth analysis was used to estimate handgun carrying trajectories. <h3>Results</h3> In this longitudinal rural sample of 2002 students, 1040 (51.9%) were male; 532 (26.6%) were Hispanic, Latino, Latina, or Latinx; 1310 (65.4%) were White; and the highest level of educational attainment of either parent was a high school degree or less for 649 students (32.4%). The prevalence of handgun carrying in the last 12 months ranged from 5.3% (95 of 1795) to 7.4% (146 of 1969) in adolescence and increased during the mid-20s (range, 8.9% [154 of 1722] to 10.9% [185 of 1704] from 23 to 26 years of age). Among the participants who reported handgun carrying at least once between 12 and 26 years of age (n = 601 [30.0%]), 320 (53.2%) reported carrying a handgun in only 1 wave. Latent class growth analysis indicated 6 longitudinal trajectories: never or low probability of carrying (1590 [79.4%]), emerging adulthood carrying (166 [8.3%]), steadily increasing carrying (163 [8.1%]), adolescent carrying (53 [2.6%]), declining carrying (24 [1.2%]), and high probability and persistent carrying (6 [0.3%]). The earliest mean (SD) age at initiation of handgun carrying occurred in both the adolescent and declining carrying groups at the ages of 12.6 (0.9) and 12.5 (0.7) years, respectively. More than 20% of some groups (emerging adulthood [age 26 years: 49 of 154 (31.8%)], steadily increasing [age 26 years: 37 of 131 (28.2%)], declining [age 13 years: 7 of 23 (30.4%)], and high probability and persistent carrying [age 15 years: 3 of 6 (50.0%)]) reported carrying 40 times or more in the past year by the age of 26 years. <h3>Conclusions and Relevance</h3> This study found distinct patterns of handgun carrying from adolescence to young adulthood in rural settings. Findings suggest that promoting handgun safety in rural areas should start early. Potential high-risk trajectories, including carrying at high frequencies, should be the focus of future work to explore the antecedents and consequences of handgun carrying in rural areas.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2022.5127,
Association between trajectories of maternal depression and subsequent psychological functioning in youth with and without chronic physical illness.,"The aim of this study was to determine if the presence of youth chronic illness moderates the association between trajectories of maternal depressive symptoms and psychological functioning in youths. Data came from the National Longitudinal Survey of Children and Youth (N = 11,813). Using the 12-item version of the Center for Epidemiological Studies Depression Scale (CES-D), symptom trajectories were estimated by latent class growth modeling over 3 measurement occasions (when their children were 10-11, 12-13, and 14-15 years). The moderating effect of youth chronic illness on the association between maternal depression and youth psychological functioning at 16-19 years was tested using multiple regression. Three measures of psychological functioning were assessed: anger regulation (Bar-On Emotional Quotient Inventory), self-concept (Self-Determination Questionnaire), and depressive symptoms (CES-D). Four trajectories (low, decreasing, increasing, high) of maternal depression were identified. The association of maternal depressive symptoms on youth psychological functioning was modified by chronic illness; less favorable trajectories of maternal depression had a more pronounced detrimental association on youths with chronic illness compared to controls. Youths with chronic illness are particularly vulnerable to the negative psychological exposure of maternal depressive symptoms during the transition to adulthood. Family-centered transition of care programs in the medical setting may be beneficial in reducing the association between symptoms of maternal depression and youth psychological functioning.",https://doi.org/10.1037/hea0000226,
Describing Callous Unemotional Traits and Stressful Life Event Trajectories: Differences on Risk Factors and Mental Health Outcomes from the Age of 3 to 10,"Callous Unemotional (CU) traits are associated with different environmental risk factors, such as negative stressful life events (SLE). The most common studied SLE associated with CU trait has been childhood maltreatment, but less is known about how other SLE impact the development of CU traits. Therefore, this work examines risk factors, personal factors (executive functioning), and mental health outcomes associated with the trajectories of Callous Unemotional (CU) traits and Stressful Life Events (SLE) in a community sample of children. A cohort of 377 preschoolers were followed up between ages 3 and 10. Several risk factors and outcomes for three trajectory groups (high CU/SLE; high CU/low SLE; and the reference group with low CU/SLE) were analyzed by using multiple post-hoc comparisons. We hypothesized that children with high CU/SLE would face more contextual risk factors, more executive functioning difficulties and more mental health problems than children with high CU/low SLE or the reference group. At the age of 3, children who showed high CU/SLE faced more early contextual adversity, including socioeconomic difficulties and maternal antisocial behavior than the other groups of children. At the age of 10, children with high CU/SLE presented more peer problems and higher psychopathology symptoms than the reference group, but no differences on mental health outcomes in comparison to the high CU/low SLE group. These results have potential implications for clinical practice and studies attempting to identify different CU subtypes in children.",https://doi.org/10.1017/sjp.2022.13,
Mental health trajectories in undergraduate students over the first year of university: a longitudinal cohort study,"Objective This study examined the association between candidate psychosocial and lifestyle variables and the trajectories of clinically significant anxiety and depressive symptoms from entry to completion of first-year university. Design A longitudinal cohort study Participants First-year undergraduate students Methods We analysed the responses of 1686 first-year undergraduate students attending Queen’s University who completed electronic surveys at both the beginning and completion of their academic year. Predictors of change in positive anxiety and depressive symptom screens (based on exceeding validated symptom threshold scores) were identified using logistic regression. Results Increased university connectedness reduced the odds of emergent significant depressive and anxiety symptoms in healthy students and increased the odds of recovery in students who screened positive at the start of university. Students who screened positive for depression or anxiety at university entry were less likely to recover if they had a lifetime history of internalising disorders. Healthy students who increased their drug use over their first year had higher odds of developing significant levels of both anxiety and depressive symptoms by completion of the academic year. Conclusions Moderate to severe levels of anxiety and depressive symptoms are common among students at entry to university and persist over the first year. University connectedness may mitigate the risk of persistent or emergent symptoms, whereas drug use appears to increase these risks. Findings have implications for university well-being initiatives.",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2020-047393,
"Poor, Unsafe, and Overweight: The Role of Feeling Unsafe at School in Mediating the Association Among Poverty Exposure, Youth Screen Time, Physical Activity, and Weight Status","This study applied socioecological and cumulative risk exposure frameworks to test the hypotheses that 1) the experience of poverty is associated with feeling less safe at school, and 2) feeling less safe is associated with engaging in poorer weight-related behaviors, as well as an increased probability of being overweight or obese. Data were from the ongoing Québec Longitudinal Study of Child Development, initiated in 1998 with a population-based cohort of 2,120 Québec (Canada) infants 5 months of age and their parent or primary caregiver. Measures of youths' (age, 13 years) self-reported feelings of safety, screen time, physical activity, and objectively assessed not overweight/obese (70%), overweight (22%), and obese (8%) weight status were collected in 2011. Family poverty trajectory from birth was assessed by using latent growth modeling. As hypothesized, exposure to poverty was associated with feeling less safe at school and, in turn, with an increased probability of being overweight or obese. The association was most pronounced for youths who experienced chronic poverty. Compared with youths who experienced no poverty and felt unsafe, those who experienced chronic poverty and felt unsafe were nearly 18% more likely to be obese (9.2% vs. 11.2%). Although feeling unsafe was associated with screen time, screen time did not predict weight status.",https://doi.org/10.1093/aje/kwv005,
"Gender differences in the development of conduct problems: trajectories, predictors, and outcomes through childhood","Abstract Gender differences in the trajectories of conduct problems (CP) have received very little attention in the literature. The present four-year longitudinal study explores gender differences in CP trajectories through early childhood, assessing gender-specific predictors and outcomes. Gender-separated CP trajectories were identified in a sample of 2,246 young children ( M age =4.25; 48.53% girls) using latent class growth analyses (LCGA). Five trajectories were found in girls (i.e., low , average , downward , upward , and stable high ) and four in boys (i.e., low , average , stable high , and upward ). Low socioeconomic status was related to the most problematic trajectories only in boys, whereas the interpersonal psychopathic trait (grandiose-deceitful) was more pronounced in girls with higher CP scores relative to other psychopathic traits. Meanwhile, boys’ trajectories were more varied in terms of negative outcomes (e.g., bullying, victimization) than those of girls. This study contributes to the body of work on heterogeneity in CP by identifying different trajectories according to gender, and shows the relevance of gender in understanding the predictors, development, and outcomes of CP.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-3412620/v1,
Associations between developmental timing of child abuse and conduct problem trajectories in a UK birth cohort,"Abstract Background Although there is strong evidence for a relationship between child abuse and neglect and conduct problems, associations between child abuse experienced at different developmental stages and developmental trajectories of conduct problems have not been examined. We sought to investigate effects of timing of child abuse on conduct problem trajectories in a large UK birth cohort study. Methods We applied latent class growth analysis to identify conduct problem trajectories in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, using parent-rated conduct problems from ages 4-17 years ( N =10648). Childhood-only and adolescence-only abuse, in addition to abuse in both developmental periods (‘persistent’ abuse), were assessed by retrospective self-report at age 22 years ( N =3172). Results We identified four developmental trajectories: early-onset persistent (4.8%), adolescence-onset (4.5%), childhood-limited (15.4%), and low (75.3%) conduct problems. Childhood-only abuse and ‘persistent’ abuse were associated with increased odds of being on the early-onset persistent and adolescence-onset conduct problem trajectories compared to the low conduct problems trajectory. Adolescence-only abuse was not predictive of trajectory membership. There were no associations between abuse and childhood-limited trajectory membership. Conclusions Early-onset persistent and adolescence-onset conduct problems showed similar patterns of association with abuse exposure, challenging developmental theories that propose qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, differences in environmental risk factors between these trajectories. The results also highlight that childhood-only and ‘persistent’ abuse were more strongly linked to elevated conduct problem trajectories than adolescence-only abuse, and that ‘persistent’ abuse is particularly detrimental.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-60834/v3,

"What makes children aged 10 to 13 engage in problematic smartphone use? A longitudinal study of changing patterns considering individual, parental, and school factors","Abstract Background and aims The current research aimed to discover classification concerning problematic smartphone use in children. Furthermore, to investigate their longitudinal trajectories, as well as to discover the connection concerning problematic smartphone usage by individual, parental, and school factors. Methods A total of 2,399 South Korean children who were in the 4th grade (female 1,206 (50.3%), age 10–13 years) at baseline. Latent class growth analysis was utilized to discover typologies in problematic smartphone use and their longitudinal trajectories. Multinomial logistic regression analysis was used to find various associations among problematic smartphone use and individual, parental, as well as school factors. Results The results identified three distinct trajectories of problematic smartphone use: (1) a high-level group (7.7%), (2) a mid-increasing group (62.5%), and (3) a low-increasing group (29.8%). The increasing group showed the highest level of problematic smartphone use. Gender, self-esteem, social withdrawal, exercise, parental inconsistency, monthly income, and teacher support were significant predictors. Discussion and Conclusions The findings suggest that there are distinct developmental trajectories concerning problematic smartphone usage of childhood. The results show that the early discovery of children in danger of problematic smartphone use and targeted interventions aimed at reducing parental inconsistency and social withdrawal, improving self-esteem, exercise, and teacher support may be effective strategies for preventing problematic smartphone usage during childhood.",https://doi.org/10.1556/2006.2024.00002,
"State alcohol policies, taxes, and availability as predictors of adolescent binge drinking trajectories into early adulthood","Abstract Background and Aims A number of alcohol policies in the United States have been presumed to reduce underage youth drinking. This study characterized underage youth binge‐drinking trajectories into early adulthood and tested associations with the strength of the alcohol policy environment, beer excise taxes and number of liquor stores. Design Longitudinal cohort study. Setting United States. Participants A national cohort of 10th graders in 2010 ( n = 2753), assessed annually from 2010 to 2015. Measurements Participants reported on their 30‐day binge drinking [defined as consuming five or more+ (for boys) or four or more (for girls) drinks within 2 hours]. We scored the strength of 19 state‐level policies at baseline and summarized them into an overall score and two subdomain scores. We also assessed state beer excise taxes (dollars/gallon) and linked the number of liquor stores in 1 km to the participants’ geocoded address. Findings We identified five binge‐drinking trajectories: low‐risk (32.9%), escalating (26.1%), late‐onset (13.8%), chronic (15.1%) and decreasing (12.0%). Lower overall alcohol policy strength was associated with increased risk of being in the escalating versus low‐risk binge‐drinking class [relative risk ratio (RRR) = 1.44 per 1 standard deviation (SD) in policy score; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 1.17, 1.77)]. Higher beer excise taxes were associated with a reduced risk of being in the escalating class (RRR = 0.22 per 1‐dollar increase; 95% CI = 0.09, 0.50). The number of liquor stores was not significantly associated with any binge‐drinking trajectory. Conclusions In the United States, stronger state alcohol policies and higher beer excise taxes appear to be associated with lower risk of escalating alcohol consumption trajectories among underage youth.",https://doi.org/10.1111/add.14600,
Patterns of Cocaine Use During Treatment: Associations With Baseline Characteristics and Follow-Up Functioning,"Objective: Abstinence outcomes are typically prioritized in the treatment of cocaine use disorder while ignoring patterns of low-frequency cocaine use. This study examined patterns of cocaine use frequency during treatment and evaluated how these patterns related to baseline characteristics and functioning outcomes 6 and 12 months after treatment. Method: We used a pooled dataset (N = 720) from seven randomized clinical trials for cocaine use disorder. The Addiction Severity Index (ASI) was used to assess functioning. Repeated-measures latent class analysis was used to derive patterns of cocaine use. Results: Three patterns were identified: abstinence (10.6%), low-frequency use (approximately 1 day/week; 66.3%), and persistent frequent use (approximately 4 days/week; 23.1%). The low-frequency group was associated with male gender, younger age, and a criminal justice referral. The abstinent group had the highest alcohol problem severity score at baseline. At Month 6, the low-frequency group reported lower problem severity than the persistent frequent use group across multiple ASI areas, including the cocaine use as well as psychological, family, employment, and legal domains. At Month 12, the low-frequency group did not differ from the abstinent group in problem severity on any ASI domain and, relative to the persistent frequent use group, had lower cocaine use and employment problem severity. Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of adopting a harm reduction approach and recognizing the potential clinical benefits associated with nonabstinent outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.15288/jsad.2019.80.431,
Exposure to Intimate-Partner Violence and Resilience Trajectories of Adolescents: A Two-Wave Longitudinal Latent Transition Analysis,"Despite the serious emotional and social consequences of adolescents’ exposure to intimate-partner violence (IPV) and the high prevalence of this exposure, few analyses have focused on person-centered models or considered psychological IPV. Studies that address exposure to violence tend to focus on physical IPV. Therefore, in this study, we examine (across two waves) the trajectories of resilience among adolescents who have witnessed psychological IPV by conducting a latent transition analysis and predicting class membership through socio-demographic and individual-level protective factors. Using a sample of 879 (T1, fall 2020) and 770 (T2, spring 2022) adolescent Swiss students with mean ages of 11.74 (SD = 0.64) and 13.77 (SD = 0.53), we identified four distinct time-invariant resilience classes: comorbid-frustrated, internalizing-frustrated, comorbid-satisfied, and resilient. The classes characterized by some level of psychopathological symptoms and basic psychological-needs frustration were the most stable over time. Furthermore, we found the four typical resilience trajectories: recovery, chronic, delayed, and improving. Gender, socioeconomic background, and protective factors showed a significant prediction of class membership in wave 1, highlighting the importance of increasing sensitivity to psychological-IPV exposure on the one hand, and reinforcing the relevance of prevention in schools regarding the promotion of protective factors on the other.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph20095676,
Multiple trajectories of alcohol use and the development of alcohol use disorder: Do Swiss men mature-out of problematic alcohol use during emerging adulthood?,"(a) Objective This study aimed to identify trajectories of alcohol use (AU) and their associations with the development of alcohol use disorder (AUD) among young men with different weekly drinking patterns. (b) Method A longitudinal latent class analysis integrating several aspects of AU, such as drinking quantity and frequency on weekends vs workweek days, involving 4719 young Swiss men at ages 20, 21, and 25, and collected by the Cohort Study on Substance Use Risk Factors, was used to identify different AU trajectories over time. The development of AUD scores in these trajectories was investigated using generalized linear mixed models. (c) Results Six AU trajectory classes, similar to those described in the literature, were identified: 'abstainers–light drinkers', 'light workweek increasers', 'light decreasers', 'moderate weekend decreasers', 'moderate workweek increasers', and 'heavy drinkers'. Only 12% of participants were assigned to a trajectory class with decreasing AU associated with a decline in their AUD score. AUD scores increased in trajectory classes exhibiting increasing AU on workweek days, despite low and moderate general AU. Finally, more than 59% of participants were on an AU trajectory presenting no change in their mean AUD score over time. (d) Conclusions Maturing out of problematic AU in emerging adulthood is not the norm in Switzerland, and the AUD score developed in late adolescence remains until at least emerging adulthood. AU on workweek days is a more practical marker of potentially problematic AU. This calls for timely interventions in adolescence and concerning regular drinking on workweek days in emerging adulthood.",https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pone.0220232,
Identification of subgroups of terror attacks with shared characteristics for the purpose of preventing mass-casualty attacks: a data-mining approach,"Abstract Security and intelligence agencies around the world invest considerable resources in preventing terrorist attacks, as these may cause strategic damage, national demoralization, infringement of sovereignty, and government instability. Recently, data-mining techniques have evolved to allow identification of patterns and associations in criminal data that were not apparent using traditional analysis. The aim of this paper is to illustrate how to use interpretable classification algorithms to identify subgroups (“patterns”) of terrorist incidents that share common characteristics and that result in mass fatalities. This approach can produce insights far beyond those of conventional macro-level studies that use hypothesis-testing and regression models. In addition to this methodological contribution, from a practical perspective, exploring the characteristics identified in the “patterns” can lead to prevention strategies, such as alteration of the physical or systemic environment. This is in line with situational crime prevention (SCP) theory. We apply our methodology to the Global Terrorism Database (GTD). We present three examples in which terror attacks that are described by a particular pattern (set of characteristics) resulted in a high probability of mass casualties, while attacks that differ in just one of these characteristics (i.e., month of attack, geographical area targeted, or type of attack) resulted in far fewer casualties. We propose exploration of the differentiating characteristic as a means of reducing the probability of mass-fatality terrorist incidents.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s40163-019-0109-9,
Co‐occurring trajectory of housing stability and parenting stress with child behavior problems: A randomized trial of a housing intervention for young mothers experiencing homelessness,"Abstract This study examined the effects of an integrative housing intervention (Ecologically Based Treatment, EBT – independent housing and supportive services) on the co‐occurring pattern of housing stability and parenting stress among a sample of substance‐using mothers who experience homelessness and have young children in their care. The association between the co‐occurring patterns of housing stability and parenting stress and child internalizing and externalizing behaviors was also examined. Mothers were randomized to one of the three conditions: EBT ( n = 80), Housing‐only (HOU; n = 80), or Services as Usual (SAU; n = 80). Follow‐up assessments were completed at 3‐, 6‐, 9‐, and 12‐months post‐baseline. The dual‐trajectory latent class growth analyses identified five subgroups of co‐occurring patterns: low‐greatly improved housing paired with moderate‐improved parenting stress, low‐greatly improved housing paired with high‐improved parenting stress, low‐moderately improved housing paired with moderate‐static parenting stress, low‐worse housing paired with moderate‐improved parenting stress, and low‐worse housing paired with high‐static parenting stress. Findings showed that EBT was more effective in improving housing stability and reducing parenting stress compared to HOU and SAU conditions, and further, HOU was more effective than SAU. Additionally, children whose mothers reported increased housing stability together with improved parenting stress had lower levels of internalizing and externalizing behaviors. The findings provide support to the efficacy of EBT in increasing housing stability and reducing parenting stress. The observed improvements subsequently benefited children's behavioral outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1111/famp.12954,
Parental ADHD and Depression: Time-Varying Prediction of Offspring Externalizing Psychopathology,"Parental attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and depression are risk factors for negative child outcomes, but given their frequent co-occurrence and variability over time, developmentally sensitive studies are needed. To characterize change in parental ADHD and depression as predictors of change in child ADHD and oppositional defiant disorder (ODD), 230 five- to ten-year-old children with (n = 110) and without (n = 120) ADHD were followed prospectively for 2 years with 90% retention. At baseline and again 2 years later (i.e., Wave 2), parents self-reported their ADHD and depression; parents and teachers also separately rated child ADHD and ODD, as well as broader attention and externalizing problems. Controlling for child sex, race-ethnicity, age, and parental depression, generalized estimating equations revealed that 2-year decreases in parental ADHD significantly predicted reduced child ADHD symptoms, but only among non-ADHD youth. Alternatively, increasing parental depression positively predicted change in teacher-rated ODD symptoms. These findings provide quasi-experimental evidence that parental ADHD and depression may be time-varying risk factors with respect to key dimensions of child externalizing behavior problems. We consider the potential dynamic and reciprocal interrelations among parental ADHD and depression with developmental change in offspring ADHD and ODD. We also discuss implications of parent psychopathology in the development of interventions to reduce the burden of youth ADHD and associated externalizing behavior.",https://doi.org/10.1080/15374416.2016.1183495,
"A Scoping Review of Children, Empowerment and Smartphone Technology Regarding Social Construction Theory with the Aim of Increasing Self-Direction in Democracies","Children—Dependents in Social Construction Theory—are assessed within democracies regarding their ability to self-direct their behavior concerning their associated society. In this regard, childhood represents a lack of self-direction, a life period when people require the guidance and protection of adults. The assumed necessity of adults supervising children in democracies requires substantial social resources, reducing the self-direction of those charged with overseeing children. Given that self-direction defines the optimal experience of people within democratic society, finding ways to increase the self-direction of children is an individual and a social benefit. In this regard, smartphones have improved self-direction in children. How children have become empowered to self-direct their lives with smartphone use considering Social Construction Theory—as Advantaged, Contenders, or Deviants—is the focus of a scoping review conducted on “children, empowerment, smartphones” of the following databases: OVID, JSTOR, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The result is that children permitted to self-direct their activities aided by smartphone technology have comparable social behavior to adults positioned as Advantaged, Contenders, or Deviants and, as such they should be encouraged to utilize smartphone technology to improve their self-direction, as doing so will augment individual and caregiver self-direction, providing increased social benefit.",https://doi.org/10.20944/preprints202402.0576.v1,
Using machine learning to identify early predictors of adolescent emotion regulation development,"This paper set out to identify the most important early early predictors of emotion regulation development from many (87) candidates using the machine learning algorithm SEM forests. Candidate predictors were selected based on a prior text mining systematic review of 6305 papers. Participants were 497 Dutch adolescents. Predictors were assessed at age 13, and emotion regulation development from age 14-18 was described using a quadratic latent trajectory model. SEM-forests were used to group adolescents with similar trajectories, based on their scores on the predictors. This person-centered approach not only identifies groups of adolescents with similar trajectories, but also indicates why some adolescents follow similar trajectories. The results indicated that individual differences (e.g., in personality) and conflict behaviors in relationships with parents and friends, and internalizing and externalizing were important early predictors. Less important were parenting behaviors, except autonomy support and invasive parenting, bullying and victimization, delinquent peers, and substance use. The implications of these findings for theory formation and intervention are discussed, and we present an open source risk assessment tool, ERRATA.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/rbqf9,
Eighth Annual Conference of inVIVO Planetary Health: From Challenges to Opportunities,"inVIVO Planetary Health (inVIVO) is a progressive scientific movement providing evidence, advocacy, and inspiration to align the interests and vitality of people, place, and planet. Our goal is to transform personal and planetary health through awareness, attitudes, and actions, and a deeper understanding of how all systems are interconnected and interdependent. Here, we present the abstracts and proceedings of our 8th annual conference, held in Detroit, Michigan in May 2019, themed ""From Challenges, to Opportunities"". Our far-ranging discussions addressed the complex interdependent ecological challenges of advancing global urbanization, including the biopsychosocial interactions in our living environment on physical, mental, and spiritual wellbeing, together with the wider community and societal factors that govern these. We had a strong solutions focus, with diverse strategies spanning from urban-greening and renewal, nature-relatedness, nutritional ecology, planetary diets, and microbiome rewilding, through to initiatives for promoting resilience, positive emotional assets, traditional cultural narratives, creativity, art projects for personal and community health, and exploring ways of positively shifting mindsets and value systems. Our cross-sectoral agenda underscored the importance and global impact of local initiatives everywhere by contributing to new normative values as part of a global interconnected grass-roots movement for planetary health.",https://doi.org/10.3390/ijerph16214302,
Identifying and Predicting Multiple Trajectories of Alcohol Dependence Symptoms in a Canadian Sample of Emerging Adults,"Working with data from the Manitoba Longitudinal Study of Young Adults (four cycles over 4 years; mean baseline age of 18.9 years), this study used latent class growth analysis to identify four alcohol dependence trajectory classes—low, decreasing (nondependence); high, decreasing (developmentally limited); low, increasing (adult onset); and persistently class were also identified: Being male, illicit drug use, stressful life events, impulsivity, and escape-avoidance coping style were all associated with increased probability of being in the more symptomatic trajectory classes, while self-esteem was associated with increased probability of being in the low symptom class. The results are discussed in relation to the issue of multifinality and implications for diagnoses, treatment, and prevention.",https://doi.org/10.1177/2167696819847324,
Externalizing Behavior and Academic Achievement : Do Causal Relations Exist?,"Children’s low academic skills are associated with a variety of behavior problems and maladaptive outcomes throughout childhood and adulthood. Given the prevalence of behavioral disorders is approximately 19% of all US children, understanding of the mechanisms through which academic achievement and externalizing behavior problems interact can inform effective intervention to prevent persistent academic failure, chronic behavioral difficulties, and related negative long-term outcomes. The purpose of this study, therefore, was to systematically review research on the association between low academic achievement and externalizing behavior problems, as well as evaluate the research indicating causal linkages, if any, between the two domains. Five databases were searched, including OVID Medline, PsycInfo, Academic Search Premier, ERIC, Education Resource and PROQUEST. Search terms included statistical designs that could support a hypothetical causal association (e.g., structural equation modeling). We screened a total of 1,990 studies, of which 26 met the final inclusion criteria. In total, ten studies reported significant negative effects between the two domains, of which only six reported effect sizes that could be considered meaningful. All but two reported these effects in the direction of early externalizing behavior problems to later academic achievement. Overall, there was inconclusive evidence for either a causal or predictive relationship. Implications for future research and educational practice are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/xrv8y,
Using a Person-Oriented Approach in Nursing Research,"The purpose of this article was to provide an overview of the person-oriented approach, describe empirical examples of its use, and discuss how the approach may be used in nursing research. The person-oriented approach consists of theoretical and methodological components and provides a way to explore the heterogeneity of populations related to phenomena of interest. For analytic purposes, the person-oriented approach views the person as a holistic unit rather than a sum of his or her characteristics, and thus, it provides an alternative or complementary approach to the more traditional, variable-oriented approaches most commonly used to study health phenomena. Although the person-oriented approach has not been used extensively in nursing research, it offers promise for nursing scholars who study complex problems within heterogeneous populations and who seek to develop targeted interventions to more effectively promote desired health outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0193945915602856,
Resilience trajectories and links with childhood maltreatment in adolescence: a latent growth modeling approach,"The current definitions of resilience can be addressed as a process, an outcome, or a trait. Empirical studies should be carried out to determine the most appropriate definition for it. Therefore, the main aim of the current study was to investigate changes in adolescents' resilience over two years and explore the links between resilience and different forms of child maltreatment.The three-wave longitudinal study ""Stress and resilience in adolescence"" (STAR-A) sample was comprised of a general school-based sample of Lithuanian adolescents [baseline N = 1295, 56.7% females; M(SD)age = 14.24 (1.26)]. Resilience was measured using the 14-item Resilience Scale (RS-14), lifetime exposure to maltreatment was measured at wave 1 using a questionnaire developed by the Norwegian Center for Violence and Traumatic Stress Studies (NKVTS), risk of psychopathology-using the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire (SDQ). The changes in resilience scores over the period of two years were investigated using the latent growth modeling approach.The analyses revealed two classes of resilience-stable higher and stable lower. We found that experience of at least one form of abuse was significantly more prevalent in the lower resilience group in comparison to the higher resilience group. Also, adolescents with lower resilience had a higher probability of psychopathology.This study provided meaningful insights into the stability of resilience over time in adolescence and its relation to various types of child maltreatment. Experiences of maltreatment, as well as risk for psychopathology, were linked to lower resilience in adolescence.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s13034-023-00558-2,
Random effects regression mixtures for analyzing infant habituation,"Random effects regression mixture models are a way to classify longitudinal data (or trajectories) having possibly varying lengths. The mixture structure of the traditional random effects regression mixture model arises through the distribution of the random regression coefficients, which is assumed to be a mixture of multivariate normals. An extension of this standard model is presented that accounts for various levels of heterogeneity among the trajectories, depending on their assumed error structure. A standard likelihood ratio test is presented for testing this error structure assumption. Full details of an expectation-conditional maximization algorithm for maximum likelihood estimation are also presented. This model is used to analyze data from an infant habituation experiment, where it is desirable to assess whether infants comprise different populations in terms of their habituation time.",https://doi.org/10.1080/02664763.2014.1000272,

Health trajectories of international humanitarian aid workers: growth mixture modelling findings from a prospective cohort study,"Most staff stay healthy during humanitarian work, although some worsen. Mean scores on health indicators may be masking individual participants struggling with health issues.To investigate different field assignment-related health trajectories among international humanitarian aid workers (iHAWs) and explore the mechanisms used to stay healthy.Growth mixture modelling analyses for five health indicators using pre-/post-assignment and follow-up data.Among 609 iHAWs three trajectories (profiles) were found for emotional exhaustion, work engagement, anxiety and depression. For post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms, four trajectories were identified. The 'healthy/normative' trajectory had the largest sample size for all health indicators (73-86%). A stable (moderate) 'ill health' trajectory was identified for all health indicators (7-17%), except anxiety. An 'improving' trajectory was found for PTSD and anxiety symptoms (5-14%). A minority of staff (4-15%) worsened on all health indicators. Deterioration continued for PTSD, depressive symptoms and work engagement 2 months post-assignment. A strong sense of coherence was associated with higher odds of belonging to the 'healthy' trajectory. Female biological sex was associated with higher odds of belonging to the 'worsening' depression and anxiety trajectories. Extended duration of field assignment was related to higher odds of belonging to the 'worsening' depressive symptoms trajectory.Most iHAWs stayed healthy during their assignment; a stable 'ill health' trajectory was identified for most health indicators. Sense of coherence is an important mechanism for understanding the health of all iHAWs in the different health trajectories, including the 'healthy' profile. These findings give new possibilities to develop activities to prevent worsening health and help strengthen iHAWs' ability to remain healthy under stress.",https://doi.org/10.1192/bjo.2023.58,

Psychological Resilience to Major Socioeconomic Life Events,"Understanding who in the population is psychologically resilient in the face of major life events, and who is not, is important for policies that target reductions in disadvantage. In this paper we construct a measure of adult resilience, document its distribution, and test its predictability by childhood socioeconomic circumstances. We use a dynamic finite mixture model applied to 17 years of panel data, and focus on the psychological reaction to ten major adverse life events. These include serious illness, major financial events, redundancy and crime victimisation. Our model accounts for non-random selection into events, anticipation of events, and differences between individuals in the immediate response and the speed of adaptation. We find considerable heterogeneity in the response to adverse events, and that resilience is strongly correlated with clinical measures of mental health. Resilience in adulthood is predictable by childhood socioeconomic circumstances; the strongest predictor is good childhood health.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/vp48c,
Polygenic risk for aggressive behaviour from late childhood through early adulthood,"Twin studies suggest a substantial role for genes in explaining individual differences in aggressive behaviour across development. It is unclear, however, how directly measured genetic risk is associated with aggressive behaviour at different moments across adolescence and how genes might distinguish developmental trajectories of aggressive behaviour. Here, a polygenic risk score derived from the EAGLE-Consortium genome-wide association study of aggressive behaviour in children was tested as predictor of latent growth classes derived from those measures in an adolescent population (n = 2229, of which n = 1259 with genetic information) and a high-risk sample (n = 543, of which n = 339 with genetic information). In the population sample, the polygenic risk score explained variation in parent-reported aggressive behaviour at all ages and distinguished between stable low aggressive behaviour and moderate and high-decreasing trajectories based on parent-report. In contrast, the polygenic risk score was not associated with self- and teacher-reported aggressive behaviour, and no associations were found in the high-risk sample. This pattern of results suggests that methodological choices made in genome-wide association studies impact the predictive power of polygenic risk scores, not just with respect to power but likely also in terms of generalizability and specificity.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/k56q8,
"Depression Comorbid With Stroke, Traumatic Brain Injury, Parkinson’s Disease, and Multiple Sclerosis: Diagnosis and Treatment","Depression is common among patients with neurologic disorders, and it has long been considered more difficult to treat than depression in the general population. In this review, the authors consider challenges in the diagnosis and treatment of depression among patients with stroke, traumatic brain injury, Parkinson's disease, and multiple sclerosis. For each disorder, the authors discuss the epidemiology and time course of depression as well as review the physiologic and psychological etiologies of depression. In addition, for each disorder, they review screening tools and diagnostic considerations, including differential diagnosis; discuss etiological factors, both neurobiological and psychological; and assess evidence for various depression treatments, including pharmacologic, psychosocial, and neuromodulatory therapies. The evidence suggests that depression is common among patients with neurologic disorders and that it is crucial for general psychiatrists to provide treatment for this population.",https://doi.org/10.1176/appi.focus.20200004,
Childhood problem behaviours as precursors of drinking to intoxication trajectories – from age 1.5 to 19,"Objective: We examined behaviour problem precursors (i.e. internalising and externalising) in childhood (ages 1.5 to 8.5) and early adolescence (age 12.5) and consequences (i.e. harmful alcohol use) in emerging adulthood (age 19), of developmental trajectories of drinking to intoxication across adolescence (ages 14.5–19).Design and outcome measures: Data from 921 children and their parents followed for 18 years from the population-based Tracking Opportunities and Problems (TOPP) Study were used to examine adolescent trajectories of drinking to intoxication. Logistic regression was used to examine predictors of trajectory group membership.Results: We identified 3 trajectory classes: low / abstainer (41%), late onset high (31%) and early onset high (28%) using latent class analyses. Logistic regression analyses showed that childhood high externalising characterised early onset of intoxication vs. other classes, while early adolescence externalising discriminated both early and late onset of intoxication. High early childhood internalising characterised those consistently low or abstinent on alcohol intoxication, while early adolescent internalising characterised those having an early onset of intoxication. However, after additional adjustment for co-occurring externalising, there were no evidence for a link between early adolescent internalising and intoxication.Conclusions: The findings suggest that both child and early adolescent-focused prevention efforts may be warranted.",https://doi.org/10.1080/08870446.2018.1478973,
Exploring Heterogeneity in perinatal depression: a systematic review,"Abstract Perinatal depression (PND) is a significant contributor to maternal morbidity globally. Recognized as a major cause of poor infant development, epidemiological and interventional research on it has increased over the last decade. Recently, studies have pointed out that PND is a heterogeneous condition, not a homogenous latent entity and a concrete diagnosis, as previously conceptualized in psychometric literature and diagnostic systems. Therefore, it is pertinent that researchers recognize this to progress in elucidating its aetiology and developing efficacious interventions. This systematic review aims to provide an updated and comprehensive account of research on heterogeneity in PND and its implications in research, public health, and clinical practice. It provides a synthesis and quality assessment of studies reporting heterogeneity in PND using cutting-edge statistical techniques and machine learning algorithms. After reporting the heterogeneous trajectories and symptom profiles of PND, it also elucidates the risk factors associated with severe forms of PND, followed by robust evidence for adverse child outcomes. Furthermore, recommendations are made to improve public health and clinical practice in screening, diagnosis, and treatment of PND.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2182733/v1,
Classes of trajectory in mobile phone dependency and the effects of negative parenting on them during early adolescence,"The aim of this study was to identify the classes of trajectory in mobile phone dependency using growth mixture modeling among Korean early adolescents from elementary school to the middle school transition. The effects of negative parenting on determining the classes were also examined. The participants were 2,378 early adolescents in the Korean Children and Youth Panel Survey. Three classes of trajectory in mobile phone dependency were found. Adolescents who were highly dependent on mobile phones were very few and most Korean adolescents were not serious with regard to mobile phone dependency. Although there was a large difference in mobile phone dependency among three classes at the very early period of adolescence, it decreased over time and all adolescents showed moderate level of mobile phone dependency. In addition, a multinomial logistic regression analysis showed that negative parenting was a significant predictor of determining the classes. The findings provided important implications for intervention and prevention of mobile phone dependency during early adolescence.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0143034317745946,
The Influence of Family and Teacher Factors on Early Disruptive School Behaviors,"The kindergarten year plays an important role in establishing children’s academic, social, and behavioral adjustment. Early identification of children who experience difficulties with the kindergarten transition is crucial to prevent continued behavioral and emotional problems. Family and school predictors of these early behavioral patterns can suggest important targets for preventive interventions. The current study examined heterogeneity in 2,814 children’s disruptive behaviors over the course of the kindergarten school year using latent profile and transition analyses. We further investigated the degree to which changes in these behavioral patterns varied as a function of family and teacher factors. Results provided evidence of three distinct profiles of disruptive behavior exhibited by kindergarteners (well-adapted, concentration problems, and at-risk), which were relatively stable over the course of the kindergarten school year. These behavioral patterns were associated with family (i.e., family problems, family involvement) but not teacher (i.e., efficacy and burnout) factors. Findings have important implications for the early identification of children at-risk for behavioral problems.",https://doi.org/10.1177/1063426615599541,
Rising High or Falling Deep? Pathways of Self–Esteem in a Representative German Sample,"In many longitudinal studies, self–esteem has been shown to increase up until around age 50 or 60 and to decrease thereafter. These studies have also found substantial inter–individual differences in the intra–individual development of self–esteem. In the current study, we examined whether this variation in change could be attributed to underlying latent classes of individuals following different trajectories of self–esteem development over time. By applying general growth mixture modelling to data from the representative German pairfam study (N = 12 377), four latent classes of self–esteem development across five years were extracted. Based on their mean levels, trajectories, and variability, individuals in the latent classes could be described as having (a) constant and stable high self–esteem (29.00% of the sample), (b) constant but variable moderate self–esteem (31.69%), (c) increasing and stabilizing self–esteem (15.13%), and (d) decreasing and variable self–esteem (24.18%). Furthermore, these latent classes differed in accordance with findings of prior research on self–rated, partner–rated, and objective correlates of the domains of health and well–being, partner relationships, and occupational status. Thus, the current study shows that inter–individual variation in intra–individual change in self–esteem is not random but reflects specific individual trajectories, or pathways, of self–esteem.

"Longitudinal phenotypes for alcoholism: Heterogeneity of course, early identifiers, and life course correlates","Abstract Alcoholism is a heterogeneous disorder; however, characterization of life-course variations in symptomatology is almost nonexistent, and developmentally early predictors of variations are very poorly characterized. In this study, the course of alcoholic symptomatology over 32 years is differentiated, and predictors and covariates of trajectory class membership are identified. A community sample of alcoholic and neighborhood matched control families, 332 men and 336 women, was recruited based on alcoholism in the men. Symptoms were assessed retrospectively at baseline (mean age = 32) back to age 15 and prospectively from baseline every 3 years for 15 years. Trajectory classes were established using growth mixture modeling. Men and women had very similarly shaped trajectory classes: developmentally limited (men: 29%, women: 42%), developmentally cumulative (men: 26%, women: 38%), young adult onset (men: 31%, women: 21%), and early onset severe (men: 13%). Three factors at age 15 predicted class membership: family history of alcoholism, age 15 symptoms, and level of childhood antisocial behavior. Numerous measures of drinking and other psychopathology were also associated with class membership. The findings suggest that clinical assessments can be crafted where the profile of current and historical information can predict not only severity of prognosis but also future moderation of symptoms and/or remission over intervals as long as decades.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579415001157,
The process of early self-control: an observational study in two- and three-year-olds,"Early individual differences in self-control are predictive of numerous developmental outcomes, such as physical health and risk-taking behaviours. Therefore, it is important to improve our understanding of how young children manage to exert self-control. This study investigates two- and three-year-old children's behaviours during two self-control tasks and the association between the occurrence of these behaviours and task success. Furthermore, the study examines relations between timing and occurrence of these behaviours and caregiver-rated self-control. Two- and three-year-olds (N = 62) were given a snack and gift delay of gratification task to measure self-control. The following behaviours were coded second-by-second during the delay: direction of visual attention and the body (directed towards or away from the reward), distracting with the hands (fidgeting), and actively 'withholding' the hands (e.g., holding one hand with the other). To assess caregiver-rated self-control, parents and teachers filled out a selected set of items from the Early Childhood Behaviour Questionnaire inhibitory control scale (Putnam et al. 2006). The percentage of time that children looked away and withheld their hands from the reward positively predicted task success, suggesting that these behaviours are strategic at this young age. Average latency of initiating these behaviours was <10 s for successful children. Teacher-rated (but not parent-rated) self-control related to both the timing and co-occurrence of these behaviours, supporting the ecological validity of the observations. These findings call for future studies to examine further how individual and contextual factors shape the fine-grained dynamics of strategy use in self-control early in life.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s11409-019-09199-3,
A longitudinal study of dispositional compassion in Syrian origin young adults resettling in the Netherlands,"Background Dispositional compassion is regarded as a facet of Agreeableness, an emotional driver of prosociality, and a primary marker of adjustment. We examined changes in dispositional compassion in Syrian young adults resettling in the Netherlands, as well as the role of migration-related and demographic variables in this change. Methods We analyzed data from a 4-wave (T1-T4), 13-month longitudinal study ( N = 168; T1 M age = 28.1 years, 70% male) using Latent Growth Curve Modelling (LGCM) in Mplus. Results Bivariate correlations indicated moderate test-retest correlations across the four waves of dispositional compassion and several correlations with the migration-related and demographic variables. A LGCM indicated a high initial level and small linear decrease in compassion over the four waves. Except for a link between pre-migration adversity and the intercept, the migration-related and demographic variables were not related to either the intercept of the slope of dispositional compassion. Conclusion Results suggest that high levels of dispositional compassion may be common for Syrian young adults with refugee backgrounds, but on average, slowly decreases over time. The cross-sectional associations between migration-related and demographic variables and dispositional compassion in the absence of a prospective one emphasize the importance of longitudinal research for understanding trajectories of adjustment.",https://doi.org/10.1177/08902070221081316,
Sustainable UNiversity Life (SUN) study: protocol for a prospective cohort study of modifiable risk and prognostic factors for mental health problems and musculoskeletal pain among university students,"Introduction Mental health problems and musculoskeletal pain are common health problems among young adults including students. Little is known about the aetiology and prognosis of these problems in university students. We aim to determine the role of personal, sociodemographic, academic and environmental factors for risk and prognosis of symptoms of depression, anxiety and stress as well as musculoskeletal pain in university students. The constructs that will be studied are based on the biopsychosocial model and psychopathology associated with disabling pain. This model acknowledges illness to consist of interrelated mechanisms categorised into biological, psychological, environmental and social cues. Methods and analysis This cohort study aims to recruit around 5000 Swedish full-time students. Data will be collected using five online surveys during one academic year. A subgroup (n=1851) of the cohort, recruited before the COVID-19 pandemic, receive weekly text messages with three short questions assessing mood, worry and pain, sent through the web-based platform SMS-track .

Treatment Outcomes for Military Veterans With Posttraumatic Stress Disorder: Response Trajectories by Symptom Cluster,"Abstract Although effective posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) treatments are available, outcomes for veterans with PTSD are relatively modest. Previous researchers have identified subgroups of veterans with different response trajectories but have not investigated whether PTSD symptom clusters (based on a four‐factor model) have different patterns of response to treatment. The importance of this lies in the potential to increase treatment focus on less responsive symptoms. We investigated treatment outcomes by symptom cluster for 2,685 Australian veterans with PTSD. We used Posttraumatic Stress Disorder Checklist scores obtained at treatment intake, posttreatment, and 3‐ and 9‐month follow‐ups to define change across symptom clusters. Repeated measures effect sizes indicated that arousal and numbing symptoms exhibited the largest changes between intake and posttreatment, d RM = −0.61 and d RM = −0.52, respectively, whereas avoidance and intrusion symptoms showed more modest reductions, d RM = −0.36 and d RM = −0.30, respectively. However, unlike the other symptom clusters, the intrusions cluster continued to show significant changes between posttreatment and 3‐month follow‐up, d RM = −0.21. Intrusion and arousal symptoms also showed continued changes between 3‐ and 9‐month follow‐ups although these effects were very small, d RM = −0.09. Growth curve model analyses produced consistent findings and indicated modest initial changes in intrusion symptoms that continued posttreatment. These findings may reflect the longer time required for emotional processing, relative to behavioral changes in avoidance, numbing, and arousal, during the program; they also reinforce the importance of prioritizing individual trauma‐focused therapy directly targeting intrusions as the core component of programmatic treatment.",https://doi.org/10.1002/jts.22299,
Study protocol for a randomized controlled trial of a group cognitive-behavioral course for depressed adolescents,"School dropout is considered a serious problem in high schools in Norway. Despite studies which emphasize the importance of mental health as a unique risk factor for dropout, interventions have only taken this into account to a limited extent. Depression is one of the most prevalent mental health issues. Here we report the study protocol of a cluster randomized controlled trial of a group-CBT intervention, ""Adolescent Coping with Depression Course"" (ACDC) for depressed adolescents in upper secondary school. The aim of this study is to investigate the extent to which ACDC can reduce depressive symptoms, prevent dropout and improve academic and social functioning among adolescents in upper secondary school. This study investigates the effectiveness of ACDC through a cluster randomized trial, in which course leaders are randomized to experimental or control conditions where the control groups receive usual care. The intervention is expected to reduce depressive symptoms among adolescents. The study will further investigate whether the intervention can prevent dropout and improve academic and social functioning among adolescents in upper secondary school.

Physical Activity and Spinal Cord Injury: Lessons Learned at the Lowest End of the Physical Activity Spectrum,"Given profound physical, psychosocial, and environmental barriers to physical activity (PA), people living with spinal cord injury (SCI) are less active than virtually every other segment of the population. Nevertheless, people with SCI are not universally ""sedentary."" Many people with SCI live physically active lives, and behavioral interventions have proven effective at increasing and maintaining both PA and fitness. This paper discusses PA and inactivity in the SCI population and reviews the who, what, and how of effective SCI PA-enhancing interventions. The authors conclude with 3 recommendations for increasing PA in other low-active populations: Know your audience and the issues, develop audience-specific messages and tailored interventions, and use behavior-change theory to develop messages and interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1123/kr.2018-0062,
Advancing Dynamic Family Theories: Applying Optimal Matching Analysis to Family Research,"Dynamic theories are centered on explaining the influences of social context and institutional structures on the life course of individuals and families. Life course development theory addresses both normative social patterns and nonnormative deviations. Life course researchers view trajectories as theoretically superior to single time‐point measures because the former look at life‐transition events in the surrounding social context, not in isolation. This article discusses advancing dynamic family theories through the methodological advancement of optimal matching analysis, a form of sequence analysis. Optimal matching analysis is compared to other event‐transition methods and is illustrated by a cohabitation‐based research question that applies optimal matching analysis to the relationship between premarital cohabitation and later marital stability.",https://doi.org/10.1111/jftr.12120,
When Acute Adversity Improves Psychological Health: A Social-Contextual Framework,"Human beings are routinely exposed to varying forms of acute adversity. Our responses take varying forms too, ranging from chronic distress to resilience. Although this pronounced variability is widely recognized, one possible outcome of acute adversity has been invariably, though understandably, ignored: an improvement in psychological and social functioning. In this analysis, I argue that, under some conditions, people can experience marked psychological improvement after acute adversity. I describe this response pattern as psychosocial gains from adversity (PGA) and define it as favorable and reliable change on an objective index of psychological functioning from before to after exposure to adversity. In the present article, I first distinguish PGA from traditional perspectives on growth after adversity on the basis of key conceptual differences. I then review empirical evidence for PGA as a replicable response pattern following different forms of adversity, including bereavement, military deployment, and mass trauma. I propose a multi-level theoretical model for PGA that focuses on automatic prosocial affiliative behaviors and group-level contextual factors that are conditioned by acute adversity. I describe moderators and boundary conditions at different levels of analysis that will enhance or detract from the likelihood of PGA. I conclude with the implications of PGA for theory and empirical research on post-adversity outcomes and outline a research agenda to better understand it.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/7caf4,
"Recurrence of post-traumatic stress disorder: systematic review of definitions, prevalence and predictors","Many people will experience a potentially traumatic event in their lifetime and a minority will go on to develop post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD). A wealth of literature explores different trajectories of PTSD, focusing mostly on resilient, chronic, recovered and delayed-onset trajectories. Less is known about other potential trajectories such as recurring episodes of PTSD after initial recovery, and to date there has been no estimate of what percentage of those who initially recover from PTSD later go on to experience a recurrence. This systematic review aimed to synthesise existing literature to identify (i) how 'recurrence' of PTSD is defined in the literature; (ii) the prevalence of recurrent episodes of PTSD; and (iii) factors associated with recurrence.",https://doi.org/10.1186/s12888-023-05460-x,
Examination of protective factors that promote prosocial skill development among children exposed to intimate partner violence,"Abstract This retrospective cohort study examined prosocial skills development in child welfare-involved children, how intimate partner violence (IPV) exposure explained heterogeneity in children’s trajectories of prosocial skill development, and the degree to which protective factors across children’s ecologies promoted prosocial skill development. Data were from 1,678 children from the National Survey of Child and Adolescent Well-being I, collected between 1999 and 2007. Cohort-sequential growth mixture models were estimated to identify patterns of prosocial skill development between the ages of 3 to 10 years. Four diverse pathways were identified, including two groups that started high (high subtle-decreasing; high decreasing-to-increasing) and two groups that started low (low stable; low increasing-to-decreasing). Children with prior history of child welfare involvement, preschool-age IPV exposure, school-age IPV exposure, or family income below the federal poverty level had higher odds of being in the high decreasing-to-increasing group compared with the high subtle-decreasing group. Children with a mother with greater than high school education or higher maternal responsiveness had higher odds of being in the low increasing-to-decreasing group compared with the low stable group. The importance of maternal responsiveness in fostering prosocial skill development underlines the need for further assessment and intervention. Recommendations for clinical assessment and parenting programs are provided.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579424000087,
Sexual Addiction 25 Years On: A Systematic and Methodological Review of Empirical Literature and an Agenda for Future Research,"In 1998, Gold and Heffner authored a landmark review in Clinical Psychology Review on the topic of sexual addiction that concluded that sexual addiction, though increasingly popular in mental health settings, was largely based on speculation, with virtually no empirical basis. In the more than two decades since that review, empirical research around compulsive sexual behaviors (which subsumes prior research about sexual addiction) has flourished, ultimately culminating in the inclusion of a novel diagnosis of Compulsive Sexual Behavior Disorder in the eleventh edition of the World Health Organization’s International Classification of Diseases. The present work details a systematic review of empirical research published between January 1st, 1995 and August 1st, 2020 related to compulsive sexual behaviors, with a specific focus on evaluating the methodologies of that literature. This review yielded 371 papers detailing 415 individual studies. In general, the present review finds that, although research related to compulsive sexual behaviors has proliferated, much of this work is characterized by simplistic methodological designs, a lack of theoretical integration, and an absence of quality measurement. Moreover, the present review finds a virtual absence of high-quality treatment-related research published within this time frame. Implications of these findings for both clinical practice and future research are discussed.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/r6947,
﻿The “Popish Midwife”: Printed Representations of Elizabeth Cellier and Midwifery Practice in Late Seventeenth-Century London,"Cet article examine le rôle joué par les imprimés dans la redéfinition de la pratique de l’obstétrique dans l’Angleterre du XVIIe siècle et analyse plus précisément trois gravures dans lesquelles on retrouve une sage-femme catholique, Elizabeth Cellier. En tant qu’élément d’un plus important corpus d’images whigs publiées, à Londres, pendant la crise occasionnée par les Bills d’exclusion entre 1678-1681, ces représentations d’Elizabeth Cellier font constamment allusion à sa présumée collaboration à un “complot papiste”, ourdi par les Catholiques dans le but de tuer le roi Charles II. Non seulement elles définissent Cellier comme une “criminelle papiste”, mais cette manière de la représenter laisserait aussi supposer que sa profession était elle-même l’un des aspects de sa déviance, car les représentations de Cellier en “sage-femme papiste” apparaissent au moment où les pratiques traditionnelles de l’obstétrique furent remises en question. Autorisées par l’Église d’Angleterre depuis 1534, elles relevaient exclusivement de la compétence des femmes. Pendant le dix-septième siècle, les sages-femmes furent de plus en plus les victimes de critiques émanant de groupes non-conformistes réprouvant les rituels anglicans concernant la naissance et du corps médical souhaitant exercer un contrôle sur les accouchements. Cet essai tentera de montrer comment ces trois gravures de Cellier firent partie de stratégies politiques et sociales complexes destinées à redéfinir l’obstétrique de telle sorte que les femmes en furent écartées au profit exclusif du corps médical masculin.",https://doi.org/10.7202/1072758ar,
Realist evaluation of a theory-based life skills programme aiming to prevent addictive behaviours in adolescents: the ERIEAS study protocol,"Introduction Adolescence is a sensitive life stage during which tobacco, alcohol and cannabis are used as ways to learn and adopt roles. There is a great deal of interest in substance use (SU) prevention programmes for young people that work to change representations of these products and help with mobilisation of life skills. Unfortunately, few existing programmes are evidence-based. In France, a programme called Expériences Animées (EA, Animated Experiences) has been developed, inspired by life skills development programmes that have been proven to be successful. The EA programme uses animated short movies and talks with high school and secondary school pupils about the use of psychoactive substances and addictions. By allowing life skills mobilisation and modifying representations and beliefs about SU, it is aimed at delaying initiation of use of psychoactive substances, preventing adolescents from becoming regular consumers, reducing the risks and harms related to the use of these substances and opening the way for adapted support measures. We are interested in understanding how, under what circumstances, through which mechanisms and among which adolescents the EA programme works. Therefore, we have developed the ERIEAS study (‘Evaluation Réaliste de l’Intervention Expériences Animées en milieu Scolaire’; Realist Evaluation of the EA Intervention in Schools). Methods and analysis EA will be conducted in 10 schools. A multi-case approach will be adopted with the aim of developing and adjusting an intervention theory. The study comes under the theory-driven evaluation framework. The investigation methodology will include four stages: (i) elaboration of a middle-range theory; (ii) data collection for validating/adjusting the theory; (iii) data analysis; and (iv) refinement and adjustment of the middle-range theory and definition of the programme’s key functions. Ethics and dissemination The study will provide evidence-based results to health authorities to help in the rollout of health promotion strategies in schools. It will provide knowledge about the strategic configurations most suitable for leading to life skills mobilisation and change young people’s representations about SU. The project will be carried out with full respect of current relevant legislation (eg, the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union) and international conventions (eg, Helsinki Declaration). It follows the relevant French legislation of the research category on interventional research protocol involving the human person. The protocol was approved by the Comité et Protection des Personnes (CPP), that is, Committee for the Protection of Persons CPP SUD-EST VI n°: AU 1525 and was reported to the Agence Française de Sécurité Sanitaire des Produits de Santé (ANSM) that is, the French National Agency for the Safety of Health Products.

"Identifying Positive Adaptive Pathways in Low-Income Families in Singapore: Protocol for Sequential, Longitudinal Mixed-Methods Design","This study aims to examine the adaptive process of children and mothers from multistressed low-income families in Singapore. It aims to bridge the knowledge gap left by existing poverty studies, which are predominately risk focused. Through a sequential longitudinal mixed-methods design, we will differentiate children and mothers who demonstrate varied social, developmental, and mental health trajectories of outcomes. Through utilizing the Latent Growth Curve Model (LGCM), we aim to detect the development and changes of the positive Family Agency and adaptive capacities of these families over time. The construct of Family Agency is underpinned by the theoretical guidance from the Social Relational Theory, which examines child agency, parent agency, relational agency, and the interactions among these members. It is hypothesized that positive Family Agency within low-income families may lead to better outcomes. The key research questions include whether the extent of positive Family Agency mediates the relationship among financial stress, resource utilization, home environment, and parental stress.The study elucidates the Family Agency construct through interviews with mother-child dyads. It also aims to understand how financial stress and resources are differentially related to home environment, parent stress, and parent and child outcomes.In phase 1, 60 mother-child dyads from families receiving government financial assistance and with children aged between 7 and 12 years will be recruited. In-depth interviews will be conducted separately with mothers and children. On the basis of 120 interviews, a measurement for the construct of Family Agency will be developed and will be pilot tested. In phase 2a, a longitudinal survey will be conducted over 3 time points from 800 mother-child dyads. The 3 waves of survey results will be analyzed by LGCM to identify the trajectories of adaptation pathways of these low-income families. In addition, 10 focus groups with up to 15 participants in each will be conducted to validate the LGCM results.This project is funded by the Social Science Research Thematic Grant (Singapore). The recruitment of 60 mother-child dyads has been achieved. Data collection will commence once the amendment to the protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board. Analysis of phase 1 data will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2019, and the first set of results is expected to be submitted for publication by the second quarter of 2019. Phase 2 implementation will commence in the second quarter of 2019, and the project end date is in May 2021.Findings from this study can potentially inform social policy and programs as it refines the understanding of low-income families by distinguishing trajectories of adaptive capacities so that policies and interventions can be targeted in enhancing the adaptive pathways of low-income families with children.PRR1-10.2196/11629.",https://doi.org/10.2196/11629,

Latent classes of posttraumatic stress symptoms in two samples of bereaved people.,"Although the heterogeneity of posttraumatic stress (PTS) symptoms has been well-documented in various traumatized samples, no study has investigated the heterogeneity of Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, PTS symptomatology in samples exclusively composed of bereaved people.We examined what classes could be distinguished based on the endorsement of self-rated Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, PTS symptoms in a sample of 509 bereaved people confronted with losses due to a variety of causes and a sample of 331 homicidally bereaved people.Associations between class membership and sociodemographic and loss-related variables were also examined.On the basis of latent class analyses, conducted in both samples separately, we identified three PTS classes: a No disturbance, Intermediate disturbance, and Pervasive disturbance class, characterized by low, moderate, and high probability of endorsement of PTS symptoms, respectively.In both samples, the largest class was characterized by participants who endorsed intermediate PTS symptom levels.As expected, being a woman, more closely related to the deceased person, more recently bereaved, and (in the sample of 509 bereaved people) confronted with unexpected loss were related to classes with more PTS disturbances.There is evidence that intermediate PTS levels are associated with negative outcomes.Because this seems to be a relative large group in the current study, it is useful to further our knowledge about variables underlying and maintaining subclinical PTS levels.",https://doi.org/10.1037/str0000121,
Childcare Attendance and Academic Achievement at Age 16 Years,"Low school preparedness is linked to high school dropout, poor employment, and negative outcomes. Childcare attendance may increase school readiness and foster academic achievement.To explore whether childcare attendance was associated with academic achievement at the end of compulsory schooling (age 16 years in the UK), whether maternal education level was a moderator, and the benefit-cost ratio of childcare regarding productivity returns of academic achievement.In this cohort study, data were included from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) born from April 1991 to December 1992 and the UK National Pupil Database for examination results. Data on academic achievement at age 16 years were available for 11 843 participants. Data were collected from June 2006 to June 2008, and data were analyzed from September 2019 to May 2020.On average, 3.7%, 5.9%, and 90.4% attended childcare full time, part time, and less than 10 hours per week, respectively. Maternal education was assessed by questionnaire during pregnancy. Analyses included weights for population representativeness and propensity score weights to account for parental selection into childcare.Academic achievement was defined as no certificate, Level 1 General Certificate of Secondary Education (GCSE; limited training), or Level 2 GCSE (qualification for academic post-16 education; high school diploma equivalent). Lifetime productivity return estimates were withdrawn from previous economic analysis based on pupil's qualifications.Of 14 541 children in the ALSPAC study, 8936 children had complete data on childcare attendance, academic achievement, and maternal education levels. Of these, 4499 (50.3%) were male. Attending childcare was associated with higher probabilities of obtaining a Level 1 or 2 GCSE qualification (Level 1: relative risk, 1.41; 95% CI, 1.16-1.73; Level 2: relative risk, 1.62; 95% CI, 1.30-2.01); however, this association was moderated by the child's maternal education level. When children of mothers with low education attended childcare, their probability of no GCSE qualification went from 28.9% (95% CI, 26.8-31.0) to 20.3% (95% CI, 18.0-22.8), whereas children of mothers with higher education had a probability of no qualification of less than 10% regardless of childcare attendance. The benefit-cost ratio for each £1 (US $1.40) invested in full-time childcare attendance for children of mothers with low education was £1.71 (95% CI, 1.03-2.45; US $2.39; 95% CI, 1.44-3.43) for those who reached a Level 2 GCSE qualification.Promoting universal childcare with facilitated access for children of lower socioeconomic backgrounds deserves to be considered as a way to reduce the intergenerational transmission of low academic achievement.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamapediatrics.2021.1192,
"Chronic, increasing, and decreasing peer victimization trajectories and the development of externalizing and internalizing problems in middle childhood","Children's peer victimization trajectories and their longitudinal associations with externalizing and internalizing problems were investigated from Grades 2 to 5. Secondary data analysis was performed with the Early Childhood Longitudinal Study (ECLS-K-2011; n = 13,860, Mage = 8.1 years old in the spring of Grade 2; 51.1% male, 46.7% White, 13.2% African-American, 25.3% Hispanic or Latino, 8.5% Asian, and 6.1% other or biracial). Children who experienced high and persistent levels of peer victimization (high-chronic victims) exhibited co-occurring externalizing and internalizing problems. Moreover, among high-chronic victims, boys had a more pronounced increase in their externalizing trajectories, and girls had greater increases in their social anxiety trajectories. In contrast, those with decreasing peer victimization across time exhibited signs of recovery, particularly with respect to their social anxiety. These findings elucidated how chronic, increasing, and decreasing victims exhibited distinct patterns in the co-occurring development of their externalizing and internalizing problems, and how findings varied depending on the form of problem behavior and by child sex.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579422000426,
Social and Environmental Factors Related to Smoking Cessation among Mothers: Findings from the Geographic Research on Wellbeing (GROW) Study,"The current study examined associations between race/ethnicity and psychosocial/environmental factors with current smoking status, and whether psychosocial/environmental factors accounted for racial differences in smoking status in a population-based sample of mothers in California.Cross-sectional data from 542 women with a history of smoking were used. Analyses adjusted for age, partner status, and educational attainment.In models adjusted for sociodemographics, black women had significantly lower odds, and Latina immigrants had significantly higher odds of being a former smoker compared to white women. Persons smoking in the home, having a majority of friends who smoke, having perceptions of their neighborhood as being somewhat or very unsafe, and experiencing food insecurity were associated with decreased odds of being a former smoker. When these variables were entered into a single model, only being a Latina immigrant and having a majority of friends who smoke were significantly associated with smoking status.Black women demonstrated a notable disparity compared with white women in smoking status, accounted for by psychosocial/environmental factors. Immigrant Latinas demonstrated notable success in ever quitting smoking. Social networks may be important barriers to smoking cessation among women.",https://doi.org/10.5993/ajhb.39.6.9,
Latent profiles of children’s autonomic nervous system reactivity early in life predict later externalizing problems,"Prior researchers have observed relations between children's autonomic nervous system reactivity and externalizing behavior problems, but rarely considers the role of developmentally regulated changes in children's stress response systems. Using growth mixture modeling, the present study derived profiles of parasympathetic nervous system reactivity (as indicated by respiratory sinus arrhythmia (RSA)) and sympathetic nervous system reactivity (as indicated by pre-ejection period (PEP)) from low income, primarily Mexican American children measured repeatedly from infancy through age 5 (N = 383) and investigated whether profiles were associated with externalizing problems at age 7. Analyses identified two profiles of RSA reactivity (reactive decreasing and U-shaped reactivity) and three profiles of PEP reactivity (blunted/anticipatory reactivity, reactive decreasing, non-reactive increasing). Compared to children with an RSA profile of reactive decreasing, those with an RSA profile of U-shaped reactivity had marginally higher externalizing problems, however, this difference was not statistically significant. Children who demonstrated a profile of blunted/anticipatory PEP reactivity had significantly higher externalizing problems compared to those with a profile of non-reactive increasing, likely related to the predominantly male composition of the former profile and predominantly female composition of the latter profile. Findings contribute to our understanding of developmental trajectories of ANS reactivity and highlight the utility of a longitudinal framework for understanding the effects of physiological risk factors on later behavior problems.",https://doi.org/10.1002/dev.22068,
Initial assessment versus gradual change in early childhood behavior problems―Which better foretells the future?,"Abstract Leading research argues the distinct importance of earliest detection of childhood behavior problems and the value of discovering subsequent change patterns as children transition through the early education years. This study examined the relative contributions of earliest assessments of children's problem behaviors as compared to the changes in those behaviors over time for the prediction of important later outcomes. Focusing on the representative national sample from the Head Start Impact Study ( n = 3,827), classroom behavior problems were assessed across 4 years spanning prekindergarten through first grade. Individual child indices were derived in multilevel growth modeling to reflect initial assessments and subsequent change patterns. These indices were thereafter applied in multilevel logistic regression and receiver operating characteristic curve analyses to predict later academic and social difficulties. Both children's initial assessments and their transitional changes proved to be good predictors of most outcomes, where the accuracy for initial assessments and transitional changes was effectively equivocal. The evidence clarifies that initial assessment of behavior problems is sufficient to predict later outcomes; additional assessments did not augment forecasting accuracy nor did the combination of both initial assessment and information about subsequent change improve accuracy. Implications are discussed for assessment theory and practice.",https://doi.org/10.1002/pits.22150,
"Calvinism, Gender Ideology, and Relational Spirituality: An Empirical Investigation of Worldview Differences","Participants were grouped on the basis of theological beliefs about divine-human and female-male dynamics using cluster analysis. We then explored whether these subgroups might differ on (a) hierarchical social expectations, (b) commitments to social justice and intercultural competence, (c) religious exploration, (d) existential defensiveness, (e) views of psychology – theology integration, and (f) perspectives on women's leadership. The sample consisted of graduate students (N = 227) at an Evangelical seminary in the Midwestern United States. Results yielded a four-cluster solution. Individuals scoring high on both Calvinist theological beliefs and complementarian gender role beliefs scored significantly higher on hierarchical relationship expectations and existential defensiveness, and preferred a Christian psychology view of integration and a male headship perspective of leadership, compared to those scoring low on Calvinism and complementarianism. In contrast, individuals scoring low on both theological dimensions scored higher on Arminianism, gender egalitarianism, social justice commitment, intercultural competence commitment, religious exploration, and they preferred an integration view of psychology and theology and a “no restrictions” perspective on women's roles. Findings highlight implications for theological training and spiritual formation.",https://doi.org/10.1177/009164711704500102,

Acute stress and PTSD among trauma-exposed children and adolescents: Computational prediction and interpretation,"Youth receiving medical care for injury are at risk of PTSD. Therefore, accurate prediction of chronic PTSD at an early stage is needed. Machine learning (ML) offers a promising approach to precise prediction and interpretation.The study proposes a clinically useful predictive model for PTSD 6-12 months after injury, analyzing the relationship among predictors, and between predictors and outcomes.A ML approach was utilized to train models based on 1167 children and adolescents of nine perspective studies. Demographics, trauma characteristics and acute traumatic stress (ASD) symptoms were used as initial predictors. PTSD diagnosis at six months was derived using DSM-IV PTSD diagnostic criteria. Models were validated on external datasets. Shapley value and partial dependency plot (PDP) were applied to interpret the final model.A random forest model with 13 predictors (age, ethnicity, trauma type, intrusive memories, nightmares, reliving, distress, dissociation, cognitive avoidance, sleep, irritability, hypervigilance and startle) yielded F-scores of.973,0.902 and.961 with training and two external datasets. Shapley values were calculated for individual and grouped predictors. A cumulative effect for intrusion symptoms was observed. PDP showed a non-linear relationship between age and PTSD, and between ASD symptom severity and PTSD. A 43 % difference in the risk between non-minority and minority ethnic groups was detected.A ML model demonstrated excellent classification performance and good potential for clinical utility, using a few easily obtainable variables.

"Impact of Sociodemographic, Premorbid, and Injury-Related Factors on Patient-Reported Outcome Trajectories after Traumatic Brain Injury (TBI)","Traumatic brain injury (TBI) remains one of the leading causes of death and disability worldwide. To better understand its impact on various outcome domains, this study pursues the following: (1) longitudinal outcome assessments at three, six, and twelve months post-injury; (2) an evaluation of sociodemographic, premorbid, and injury-related factors, and functional recovery contributing to worsening or improving outcomes after TBI. Using patient-reported outcome measures, recuperation trends after TBI were identified by applying Multivariate Latent Class Mixed Models (MLCMM). Instruments were grouped into TBI-specific and generic health-related quality of life (HRQoL; QOLIBRI-OS, SF-12v2), and psychological and post-concussion symptoms (GAD-7, PHQ-9, PCL-5, RPQ). Multinomial logistic regressions were carried out to identify contributing factors. For both outcome sets, the four-class solution provided the best match between goodness of fit indices and meaningful clinical interpretability. Both models revealed similar trajectory classes: stable good health status (HRQoL: n = 1944; symptoms: n = 1963), persistent health impairments (HRQoL: n = 442; symptoms: n = 179), improving health status (HRQoL: n = 83; symptoms: n = 243), and deteriorating health status (HRQoL: n = 86; symptoms: n = 170). Compared to individuals with stable good health status, the other groups were more likely to have a lower functional recovery status at three months after TBI (i.e., the GOSE), psychological problems, and a lower educational attainment. Outcome trajectories after TBI show clearly distinguishable patterns which are reproducible across different measures. Individuals characterized by persistent health impairments and deterioration require special attention and long-term clinical monitoring and therapy.",https://doi.org/10.3390/jcm12062246,
"Early socioemotional competence, psychopathology, and latent class profiles of reparative prosocial behaviors from preschool through early adolescence","Abstract Children who have difficulty using reparative behaviors following transgressions display a wide range of poorer social and emotional outcomes. Despite the importance of reparative skills, no study has charted the developmental trajectory of these behaviors or pinpointed predictors of poorer reparative abilities. To address these gaps in the literature, this study applied growth mixture modeling to parent reports of children's reparative behaviors (N = 230) in a 9-year longitudinal data set spanning from preschool to early adolescence. Three distinct trajectories of reparative behaviors were found: a low-stable, moderate-stable, and high-stable latent class. Poorer emotion understanding, social withdrawal, social rejection, and maladaptive guilt in the preschool period predicted membership in a low-stable reparative trajectory. Externalizing diagnoses, particularly conduct disorder and oppositional defiant disorder, also predicted membership in a low-stable reparative trajectory. Preschool-onset depression predicted membership in a low-stable reparative trajectory through high levels of maladaptive guilt. The findings from this study suggest that socioemotional deficits in the preschool period set children on longstanding trajectories of impaired reparative responding. Thus, emotion understanding, social functioning, maladaptive guilt, and early psychiatric symptoms should be targeted in early preventive interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579419000397,
Pulling through together: social media response trajectories in disaster-stricken communities,"Abstract Disasters are extraordinary shocks that disrupt every aspect of the community life. Lives are lost, infrastructure is destroyed, the social fabric is torn apart, and people are left with physical and psychological trauma. In the aftermath of a disaster, communities begin the collective process of healing, grieving losses, repairing damage, and adapting to a new reality. Previous work has suggested the existence of a series of prototypical stages through which such community responses evolve. As social media have become more widely used, affected communities have increasingly adopted them to express, navigate, and build their response due to the greater visibility and speed of interaction that these platforms afford. In this study, we ask if the behavior of disaster-struck communities on social media follows prototypical patterns and what relationship, if any, these patterns may have with those established for offline behavior in previous work. Building on theoretical models of disaster response, we investigate whether, in the short term, community responses on social media in the aftermath of disasters follow a prototypical trajectory. We conduct our analysis using computational methods to model over 200 disaster-stricken U.S. communities. Community responses are measured in a range of domains, including psychological, social, and sense-making, and as multidimensional time series derived from the linguistic markers in tweets from those communities. We find that community responses on Twitter demonstrate similar response patterns across numerous social, aspirational, and physical dynamics. Additionally, through cluster analysis, we demonstrate that a minority of communities are characterized by more intense and enduring emotional coping strategies and sense-making. In this investigation of the relationship between community response and intrinsic properties of disasters, we reveal that the severity of the impact makes the deviant trajectory more likely, while the type and duration of a disaster are not associated with it.",https://doi.org/10.1007/s42001-023-00209-8,
Childhood Sexual Abuse And Identity Development: The Role Of Attachment And Self-Esteeem,"The purpose of the study was to examine how childhood sexual abuse (CSA) influences identity development along with attachment and self-esteem. The participants included 208 first-year female undergraduate students from Illinois State University. Students were afforded the opportunity to receive extra credit for their participation and could enter into a random prize drawing. Participants completed a demographics questionnaire, Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale, The Experiences in Close Relationships Questionnaire, Dimensions of Identity Development Scale, and the Hot Topics Questionnaire which assesses history of CSA. Of the participants, 145 (69.7%) were in the non-abuse group and 63 (30.3%) were in the abuse group. Results indicated that CSA was related to higher levels of attachment anxiety, attachment avoidance, and low levels of self-esteem compared to the non-abuse group. No difference was found between the abuse and non-abuse groups on levels of commitment making, identification with commitments, or ruminative exploration. Finally, poor attachment security and low levels of self-esteem were found to be related to lower levels of commitment making, identification with commitments, and higher levels of ruminative exploration.",https://doi.org/10.30707/etd2015.dukett.j,
Childhood Trauma and Trajectories of Depressive Symptoms Across Adolescence,"Abstract Background Growth curve modelling such as trajectory analysis is useful for examining the longitudinal nature of depressive symptoms, their antecedents and later consequences. However, issues in interpretation associated with this methodology could hinder the translation from results to policy changes and interventions. The aim of this article is to provide a “model interpretation framework” for highlighting growth curve results in a more interpretable manner. Here we demonstrate the association between childhood trauma and trajectories of depressive symptoms. Childhood trauma has been shown to a be strong predictor for later depression, but less is known how childhood trauma has an effect throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Identifying when childhood trauma (and its severity) is likely to have its greatest impact on depression is important for determining the timing of interventions for depression. Methods We used data on over 6,500 individuals from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ALSPAC) to estimate trajectories of depressive symptoms between the ages of 11 and 24. Depressive symptoms were measured using the short mood and feelings questionnaire (SMFQ) across 9 occasions. Childhood trauma was assessed between the ages of 5 and 10 years old, and we estimated population averaged multilevel growth curves of depressive symptoms for exposure to trauma (yes vs no) and then in a separate model, the number of trauma types reported such as inter-personal violence or neglect (coded as 0, 1, 2, 3+). We then calculated what the depressive symptoms scores would be ages 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, between these varying trajectories. Results Reported exposure to childhood trauma was associated with less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence, mainly characterised by exposed individuals having worse depressive symptoms at age 16. There was an exposure-response relationship between the number of childhood traumas and trajectories of depressive symptoms. Individuals exposed to 3 or more types of trauma had substantially steeper and less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms: becoming worse at a more rapid rate until the age of 18. By age 18, individuals that reported the greatest exposure to trauma (3+ types of trauma) had 14% more depressive symptoms compared to non-exposed participants. Limitations This study was subject to attrition, particularly towards the latter ages of the SMFQ. Conclusion Childhood trauma is strongly associated with less favourable trajectories of depressive symptoms across adolescence. Individuals exposed to multiple types of inter-personal violence or neglect are at the greatest risk of worsening depressive symptoms throughout adolescence and young adulthood. Individuals exposed to traumatic experiences in childhood should be identified as at high risk of depression and other adverse outcomes as early trauma may disrupt social development and have lasting consequences on mental health outcomes. The model interpretation framework presented here may be more interpretable for researchers, clinicians and policy makers as it allows comparisons of depression across multiple stages of development to highlight when the effects of depression are greatest.",https://doi.org/10.1101/19002519,
"Positive parenting practices, child competence, and adolescent desistance from delinquency: Attachment and transactional effects","The current studies tested whether better child outcomes (e.g., socioemotional and cognitive competence as well as desistance from delinquency) resulted from positive parenting practices (e.g., high levels of parental sensitivity or parental warmth, or low levels of parental hostility) in a sample of children followed from toddlerhood to early adolescence (Study 1) and a sample of delinquent adolescents followed from middle through late adolescence (Study 2). The main goals were to reveal whether positive parenting practices affect child development from early childhood through adolescence across non-clinical families and families with adjudicated adolescents. The results showed that positive parenting practices impact non-clinical and adjudicated offspring across childhood. The attachment, cascade, and transactional perspectives were found to be supported in that early parental sensitivity positively affected child cognitive and socioemotional competence across time (i.e., attachment theory), child behavior problems in kindergarten worsened child academic achievement in first grade and child academic achievement in third grade unexpectedly increased child behavior problems in fifth grade (i.e., a cascade pattern), and parental sensitivity and child competence predicted one another across time (i.e., a transactional pattern). During adolescence, positive parenting practices such as low levels of parental hostility increased adolescents' chances of being in the adolescence-limited offender group and prevented adolescents from falling into the life-course-persistent offender group, although this protective effect is eliminated when the adolescent is more neurotic and participated in more delinquent acts from ages 15 through 16. This reflects the developmental taxonomy view that adolescence-limited offenders are qualitatively different from life-course-persistent offenders, who likely suffer from neuropsychological deficits and low self-control, participate in more delinquency earlier, and are less likely to be influenced by positive parenting practices. The results of these studies indicate that positive parenting practices generally benefit non-clinical children from early childhood to adolescence, how adjudicated or high-risk adolescents interpret and respond to positive parenting practices is important, and positive parenting practices may not work for youth who later become life-course-persistent offenders because of their unique characteristics.",https://doi.org/10.31274/td-20240329-592,
Criminal Careers,"Criminal Careers follows the lives and criminal behaviours of 2,397 people in Poland who as juveniles committed a crime and received a form of punishment from the juvenile court between the late 1980s and the year 2000.Through combining quantitative and qualitative research, their criminal careers, the differences between men and women, risk factors, and reasons for nondesistance are analysed.Uniquely, the authors have used an extensive database of former juveniles, in which as many as 40% were women.This book therefore makes a comparison between women and men in terms of their future life paths.Additionally, the researched group consisted of teenagers from two different periods: the 1980s (the transition generation) and 2000 (the millennial generation), which in the context of Central and Eastern European countries means that they entered adulthood in completely different realities.These differences are therefore also explored in depth within the book.By focusing on Poland, the book provides a different perspective to criminal career research, which is generally limited to a few countries in Western Europe and the United States.The book will be of great interest to academics and students who are developing their own research in the fields of criminal careers, juvenile delinquency, and antisocial behaviours by young people.It will also appeal to professionals, including juvenile judges, probation officers, staff in correctional facilities and social rehabilitation institutions, and social workers and employees of nonprofit organisations that support juveniles, people in crisis, and prisoners or exprisoners.",https://doi.org/10.4324/9781003332565,
"Early use of alcohol associated with sociodemographic, nutritional and lifestyle factors: survival analysis with Brazilian students","To evaluate the early age of onset (AOO) of alcohol consumption and its association with sociodemographic, nutritional and lifestyle characteristics.A national cross-sectional multi-centered study assessed 12-17-year old adolescents from 1247 public and private schools in 124 Brazilian municipalities with more than 100 000 habitants. Our variable of interest was the AOO of alcohol consumption. Covariates comprised sociodemographic status, lifestyle habits and nutritional parameters. We used adapted survival models to investigate the association between covariates and the AOO of alcohol consumption.From a sample of 67 672 adolescents, 50% were females. The mean AOO of alcohol consumption was 12.9 years. Male adolescents had a lower mean age of alcohol experimentation when compared to females in Northeast and South regions. The difference between private and public school for AOO was observed only for the Northeast Region (12.6 versus 13.1, respectively). Adolescents who reported smoking or mental health problems or from the Southern Region presented earlier alcohol use. Physical activity and overweight were positively associated with earlier use of alcohol.There is no homogeneity in the AOO of alcohol consumption among adolescents, which should be considered when formulating public policies and government campaigns directed toward reducing alcohol consumption.",https://doi.org/10.1093/pubmed/fdz036,
Health and well-being of serving and ex-serving UK Armed Forces personnel: protocol for the fourth phase of a longitudinal cohort study,"Introduction This is the fourth phase of a longitudinal cohort study (2022–2023) to investigate the health and well-being of UK serving (Regulars and Reservists) and ex-serving personnel (veterans) who served during the era of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. The cohort was established in 2003 and has collected data over three previous phases including Phase 1 (2004–2006), Phase 2 (2007–2009) and Phase 3 (2014–2016). Methods and analysis Participants are eligible to take part if they completed the King’s Centre for Military Health Research Health and Wellbeing Cohort Study at Phase 3 (2014–2016) and consented to be recontacted (N=7608). Participants will be recruited through email, post and text message to complete an online or paper questionnaire. Data are being collected between January 2022 and September 2023. Health and well-being measures include measures used in previous phases that assess common mental disorders, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol misuse. Other areas of interest assess employment, help-seeking and family relationships. New topics include the impact of the British withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, complex PTSD (C-PTSD), illicit drug use, gambling and loneliness. Analyses will describe the effect size between groups deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan or not deployed, and those who are currently in service versus ex-service personnel, respectively, reporting prevalences with 95% CIs, and ORs with 95% CI. Multivariable logistic and multiple linear regression analyses will be conducted to assess various health and well-being outcomes and associations with risk and protective factors. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the Ministry of Defence Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 2061/MODREC/21). Participants are provided with information and agree to a series of consent statements before taking part. Findings will be disseminated to UK Armed Forces stakeholders and international research institutions through stakeholder meetings, project reports and scientific publications.",https://doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2023-079016,
Patterns of resilient functioning in early life: Identifying distinct groups and associated factors,"Abstract Resilience, the capacity to maintain or regain functionality in the face of adversity, is a dynamic process influenced by individual, familial, and community factors. Despite its variability, distinct resilience trajectories can be identified within populations, yet the predictors defining these distinct groups remains largely unclear. Here, using data from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (ages 0-18), we quantify resilience as the remaining variance in psychosocial functioning after taking into account the exposure to adversity. Growth mixture modeling identified seven distinct resilience trajectories, with over half of the study population maintaining resilience throughout early life. Factors increasing the likelihood of resilient trajectory membership included a less emotional temperament, high cognitive abilities, high self-esteem, low levels of autistic social traits, strong sibling relationships, high maternal care, and positive school experiences. Among the socioeconomic factors considered, maternal education – a significant indicator of socioeconomic status – and birth-order were associated with resilient trajectories. Our findings underscore the importance of fostering cognitive abilities, self-esteem, social relationships, positive school experiences, and extracurricular engagement to bolster resilience in adversity-exposed individuals and communities. This research informs resilience-focused interventions in mental health, education, and social policy sectors, and prompts further exploration of socioeconomic influences on resilience trajectories.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579423001165,
Parsing Heterogeneity in Developmental Trajectories of Internalizing and Externalizing Symptomatology in the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development Study,"Background: Psychopathology demonstrates marked changes within and between individuals across development, especially during the transition from childhood to adolescence. Evidence characterizing the directionality and rate of change across distinct dimensions of psychopathology has been mixed, with different studies indicating increases, decreases, or no change in internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Moreover, much remains unknown about the extent to which trajectories differ across individuals. Methods: Using a large, diverse national sample of youth (9-10 years old at baseline) from the Adolescent Brain Cognitive Development (ABCD) Study® (n = 6,405) we tested trajectories of psychopathology over three years. At each time point, parents reported their child’s internalizing and externalizing symptoms. Results: Results from a latent growth curve model indicated that, on average, externalizing symptoms decreased across the three time points, whereas internalizing symptoms did not significantly change. We then used growth mixture modeling to identify latent subgroups of pre-adolescents with distinct psychopathology trajectories. Results indicated that there were four different internalizing trajectories: a high-stable group, a moderate-decreasing group, a moderate-increasing group, and a low-decreasing group. For externalizing symptoms, there were three trajectories: a high-decreasing group, a moderate-increasing group, and a low-decreasing group. We also used parallel process growth analysis to examine the co-development of internalizing and externalizing symptoms and identified five subgroups with distinct patterns of co-development. These subgroups were differentially associated with sex and age. Conclusion: These findings highlight important heterogeneity in the development of psychopathology during pre-adolescence.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/pz5s8,
A complex dynamical systems approach to the development of feeding problems in early childhood,"Though it is commonly agreed upon that the development of feeding problems in early childhood is a complex process, much of the research on these problems has a component-oriented focus, and very little attention is paid to the mechanisms that lead to these kinds of problems in individual children. The aim of this theoretical paper is to interpret the development of feeding problems in early childhood from a complex dynamical systems viewpoint. In addition to its focus on self-organization and nonlinearity, this approach defines several central properties of development: soft-assembly, embodiment, iterativity, the emergence of higher-order properties, and intra-individual variability. In this paper, I argue that each of these properties is highly relevant for understanding feeding problems and discuss the implications of this for both clinical practice and research purposes.",https://doi.org/10.1016/j.appet.2020.104982,
Sport Participation for Academic Success: Evidence From the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children,"Background : We aimed to identify long-term patterns of sport participation (overall, team, and individual sport) from childhood into adolescence, and to examine the association between these patterns and academic outcomes. Methods : This cohort study used data from the Longitudinal Study of Australian Children in wave 3 (4–5 y) to wave 9 (20–21 y). The participants were a nationally representative sample of 4241 children. We conducted latent class analyses to identify sport participation trajectories and assessed the association between these trajectories and academic outcomes. Results : Continued sport participation was associated with lower odds of being absent from school (OR = 0.44; 95% confidence intervals [CIs], 0.26 to 0.74), better performance on attention ( B = −0.010; 95% CIs, −0.019 to −0.002) and working memory ( B = −0.013; 95% CIs, −0.023 to −0.003), higher numeracy ( B = 20.21; 95% CIs, 14.56 to 25.86) and literacy scores ( B = 9.42; 95% CIs, 2.82 to 16.02), higher end of school academic performance ( B = 3.28; 95% CIs, 1.47 to 5.09), and higher odds of studying at university (OR = 1.78; 95% CIs, 1.32 to 2.40). Team sport participation was associated with reduced absenteeism, better performance on attention and working memory, and being awarded the Higher School Certificate. Whereas individual sport participation was associated with higher literacy scores and end of school academic performance. Conclusions : Team and individual sport participation both benefit academic outcomes, but differently. Given the decline in sport participation during adolescence, these findings highlight the need to develop educational policies to establish an environment that promotes sport participation, which in turn could improve academic outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.1123/jpah.2023-0506,
Can Having Internal Locus of Control Insure Against Negative Shocks? Psychological Evidence from Panel Data,"We investigate whether the intensity of emotional pain following a negative shock is different across the distribution of a person’s locus of control – the extent to which individuals believe that their actions can influence future outcomes. Using panel data from Australia, we show that individuals with strong internal locus of control are psychologically insured against becoming a victim of property crime and death of a close friend, but not against the majority of other life events. The buffering effects vary across gender. Our findings thus add to the existing literature on the benefits of internal locus of control.",https://doi.org/10.2139/ssrn.2616082,
An Empirical Assessment of the Sensitivity of Mixture Models to Changes in Measurement,"This study explored the extent to which variations in self-report measures across studies can produce differences in the results obtained from mixture models. Data (N = 854) come from a laboratory analogue study of methods for creating commensurate scores of alcohol- and substance-use-related constructs when items differ systematically across participants for any given measure. Items were manipulated according to 4 conditions, corresponding to increasing levels of alteration to item stems, response options, or both. In Study 1, results from latent class analyses (LCAs) of alcohol consequences were compared across the 4 conditions, revealing differences in class enumeration and configuration. In Study 2, results from factor mixture models (FMMs) of alcohol expectancies were compared across 2 of the conditions, revealing differences in patterns and magnitude of the factor loadings and thresholds. The results suggest that even subtle differences in measurement can have substantively meaningful effects on mixture model results.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10705511.2016.1257354,
Modern Methods for Modeling Change in Obesity Research in Nursing,"Persons receiving treatment for weight loss often demonstrate heterogeneity in lifestyle behaviors and health outcomes over time. Traditional repeated measures approaches focus on the estimation and testing of an average temporal pattern, ignoring the interindividual variability about the trajectory. An alternate person-centered approach, group-based trajectory modeling, can be used to identify distinct latent classes of individuals following similar trajectories of behavior or outcome change as a function of age or time and can be expanded to include time-invariant and time-dependent covariates and outcomes. Another latent class method, growth mixture modeling, builds on group-based trajectory modeling to investigate heterogeneity within the distinct trajectory classes. In this applied methodologic study, group-based trajectory modeling for analyzing changes in behaviors or outcomes is described and contrasted with growth mixture modeling. An illustration of group-based trajectory modeling is provided using calorie intake data from a single-group, single-center prospective study for weight loss in adults who are either overweight or obese.",https://doi.org/10.1177/0193945917697221,
Trajectories of neighborhood change,"Neighborhoods represent a scale at which inequalities are reflected in the unequal spatial distribution of ethnic and income groups across urban space. In many cities, the rich reside in high-quality neighborhoods in favorable locations while the poor are concentrated in disadvantaged areas (Hulchanski, 2010; Van Eijk, 2010). However, neighborhoods are not static entities and spatial patterns of socioeconomic and ethnic inequality shift over time as a result of processes of neighborhood change. Neighborhoods can develop in different ways: (1) they can gentrify which is characterized by rising house prices and the replacement of lower income groups by higher income groups (Hochstenbach & Van Gent, 2015; Newman & Wyly, 2006; Slater, 2006); (2) neighborhoods can decline which is indicated by physical deterioration and declining house prices and the succession of higher income groups by lower income groups (Grigsby et al., 1987; Prak & Priemus, 1986; Van Beckhoven et al., 2009); (3) neighborhoods can remain stable in their population composition and/or overall status for longer periods of time (Meen et al., 2013; Tunstall, 2016). There are two empirical gaps in the literature on neighborhood change that this dissertation addresses. First, there has been a lack of longitudinal studies. Many studies on neighborhood change take on a relatively short-term perspective and reduce change to the difference between two points in time. While the literature has been dominated by case-studies on gentrification or decline, fuelling the assumption that gentrification and decline are widespread processes that quickly transform neighborhoods and cities, a growing body of research suggests that neighborhoods are rather 'slothful' and that neighborhood change takes time to take effect (Tunstall, 2016; Meen et al., 2013). Overall, we have little insight into the extent to which gentrification and decline are exceptional cases, in addition to, the prevalence and rate of change across all neighborhoods over time (cf. Tunstall, 2016). Second, residential mobility is often seen as the most important driver of neighborhood change. However, residential mobility is shaped by structural factors such as the housing stock, local housing markets, and government policy (Meen et al., 2013; Nygaard & Meen, 2011). Moreover, researchers have argued that residential mobility should be understood in relation to demographic and in-situ change, which can also play an important role in processes of neighborhood change (Bailey, 2012; Finney & Simpson, 2009; Teernstra, 2014). The relative impact of the housing stock and differentpopulation dynamics on neighborhood change has however received little attention in the literature to date. This dissertation contributes to the literature on longitudinal neighborhood change, both theoretically and methodologically. Theoretically, it provides insight into diverging pathways of neighborhood change over time, illustrating how different mechanisms interact to shape the urban geography along socioeconomic and ethnic lines. The path-dependent role of the housing stock is analyzed, in addition to the extent to which changes to the housing stock as a result of urban restructuring affect residential mobility and neighborhood change. Moreover, this dissertation investigates patterns of ethnic segregation over time and explores the relative impact of residential mobility and demographic change. Methodologically, this dissertation explores innovative methods for the analysis of neighborhood trajectories, broadening the scope of statistical methods for the field of neighborhood change research. This dissertation uses individual-level administrative data from the System of Social statistical Datasets (SSD) provided by Statistics Netherlands. The SSD contains longitudinal geocoded data on the full Dutch population, as well as information on the built environment. As such, the SSD allows for the analysis of the relationship between the housing stock and population change in processes of neighborhood change. Neighborhoods are operationalized using 500 by 500 meter grids, which are the most consistent low spatial scale over time. Three out of four chapters focused on the 1999 to 2013 time period, while chapter 3 covered the 1971 to 2013 period. This dissertation employed innovative methodologies to analyze trajectories of neighborhood change over time. Chapter 3 presents a combination of sequence analysis and a tree-structured discrepancy analysis that allows for the visualization of neighborhood pathways and its relation to their contexts. Chapter 5 uses a Latent Class Growth Model (LCGM) to categorize neighborhoods based on similarities in the timing and pace of change over time. Both methodologies have proven to be valuable tools for the identification of diverging neighborhood pathways over time.",https://doi.org/10.59490/abe.2018.21.2568,
When does exposure to daily negative acts frustrate employees’ psychological needs? A within-person approach.,"Based on self-determination theory, this two-sample study investigates the effects of negative acts on psychological need frustration in greater depth using a within-person perspective. More specifically, through two distinct diary studies, we aim to contribute to the dearth of research on the daily effects of bullying by investigating the daily relationship between exposure to negative acts and need frustration as well as the moderating role of perceived emotional support at work in this relationship. Overall, results from both studies show that employees experience greater need frustration (perceptions of rejection, oppression, and incompetence) on days they are confronted with negative acts and that daily emotional support buffers the impact of direct negative acts (humiliation, physical intimidation) on frustration of the needs for competence and relatedness at the daily level. As such, the results of the present two-sample study provide a better understanding of the boundary conditions under which exposure to negative acts may result in psychological costs by identifying emotional support as a key resource in the workplace that can offset the immediate harmful effects of certain negative behaviors.

Factors predicting the stratified academic achievement trajectories of foreign-born Canadian adolescents: A population-based study,"The study looked at the stratified math and language arts trajectories of foreign-born adolescents (aged 14–19) in British Columbia (BC), Canada, and identified social position factors that predicted this variation. Leveraging data from the Ministry of Health, Ministry of Education and Citizenship and Immigration Canada, the study looked longitudinally at a population-based cohort of foreign-born adolescents in BC (N = 9,113), in comparison to a Canadian-born random sample (N = 22,845). Utilizing Group-based Trajectory Modeling, the study found that foreign-born adolescents were stratified into a range of math and language arts trajectory groups over high school (grade 10 to 12), and group membership was predicted by key social position factors. The results supported moving away from a one-size-fits-all understanding of the impact of migration on adolescent development and identified key factors that predicted math and language arts outcomes for foreign-born Canadian adolescents.",https://doi.org/10.1080/10888691.2017.1418668,
#ConnectedTeens: Social media use and adolescent wellbeing,"As there are great societal concerns about the consequences of adolescents' social media use, this dissertation investigated the relation between adolescents' social media use and wellbeing. We used longitudinal data from Dutch adolescents participating in the Digital Youth Project between 2015 and 2019, as well as (inter)nationally representative cross-sectional data ... read more from adolescents participating in the Health Behaviour in School-aged Children study in 2017/2018. In our research, we distinguished between the intensity of social media use and problematic social media use. The intensity of social media use was indicated by, for example, how many times per day someone views social network sites. Problematic social media use was characterized by symptoms of addiction to social media use, such as loss of control over social media use. Results indicated that this distinction is important. First, many adolescents engage in intensive social media use without developing problematic social media use. Second, problematic social media use seems to contribute to lower wellbeing, such as decreased life satisfaction and increased attention problems, while higher intensity of social media use in general does not. Third, in contrast to problematic social media use, we found indications that higher intensity of social media use is beneficial for adolescents' wellbeing, as our results showed that intensive users of social media perceived more friend support than non-intensive users. These findings inform professionals concerned with the wellbeing of youth that mainly problematic social media use is harmful, while higher intensity of social media use is often not. Given the potential detrimental nature of problematic social media use, prevention and intervention programs on (reducing) problematic social media use are warranted. show less",https://doi.org/10.33540/1272,
Heterogeneity in the longitudinal courses of global functioning in children at familial risk of major psychiatric disorders: Association with trauma and familial characteristics,"Abstract Objectives The extent to which heterogeneity in childhood risk trajectories may underlie later heterogeneity in schizophrenia (SZ), bipolar disorder (BP), and major depressive disorder (MDD) remains a chief question. Answers may optimally be found by studying the longitudinal trajectories of children born to an affected parent. We aimed to differentiate trajectories of global functioning and their sensitive periods from the age of 6 to 17 years in children at familial risk (FHRs). Methods First , a latent class mixed model analysis (LCMM) was applied to yearly ratings of the Children's Global Assessment Scale (CGAS) from the age of 6 to 17 years in 170 FHRs born to a parent affected by DSM‐IV SZ ( N = 37), BP ( N = 82) or MDD ( N = 51). Then, we compared the obtained Classes or trajectories of FHRs in terms of sex, parental diagnosis, IQ, child clinical status, childhood trauma, polygenic risk score (PRS), and outcome in transition to illness. Results The LCMM on yearly CGAS trajectories identified a 4‐class solution showing markedly different childhood and adolescence dynamic courses and temporal vulnerability windows marked by a functioning decline and a degree of specificity in parental diagnosis. Moreover, IQ, trauma exposure, PRS level, and timing of later transition to illness differentiated the trajectories. Almost half (46%) of the FHRs exhibited a good and stable global functioning trajectory. Conclusions FHRs of major psychiatric disorders show heterogeneous functional decline during development associated with parental diagnosis, polygenic risk loading, and childhood trauma.",https://doi.org/10.1111/bdi.13386,
Suicidal Thoughts and Trajectories of Psychopathological and Behavioral Symptoms in Adolescence,"Importance The suicidal risk of psychopathology in adolescence is suggested to differ based on its longitudinal trajectory, but the comorbidity of these symptom trajectories has not been well examined. This study comprehensively clustered trajectories of multiple psychopathological and behavioral symptoms and examined their associations with suicidal thoughts in adolescence. Objective To determine which categories and trajectories of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms are associated with suicidal thoughts in adolescence, accounting for comorbid symptoms. Design, Setting, and Participants This population-based cohort study in Japan used data from the Tokyo Teen Cohort (TTC) study, which was established in 2012 and is currently ongoing. Data from 3 waves of surveys conducted at ages 10, 12, and 16 years from October 2012 to September 2021 were used. Of the adolescents in the cohort, participants with at least 2 evaluations of psychopathological and behavioral symptoms were included. Data were analyzed from December 2022 to March 2023. Exposure Latent class growth analysis was used to cluster the trajectory of each psychopathological and behavioral symptom. Main Outcomes and Measures The associations between symptom trajectories and suicidal thoughts at age 16 were examined. Suicidal thoughts were assessed using a self-report questionnaire. Psychopathological and behavioral symptoms were assessed using the 8 subscale scores of the caregiver-report Child Behavior Checklist. Results This study included 2780 adolescents (1306 female participants [47.0%]). Of the 1920 adolescents with data on suicidal thoughts, 158 (8.2%) had suicidal thoughts. The median (IQR) age was 10.2 (10.0-10.3) years at the first evaluation, 11.9 (11.8-12.1) years at the second evaluation, and 16.3 (16.1-16.5) years at the last evaluation. The clustering pattern of trajectories varied depending on symptom categories. After adjusting for each symptom trajectory and confounders, adolescents with persistent high withdrawn symptoms (odds ratio [OR], 1.88; 95% CI, 1.10-3.21) and those with increasing somatic symptoms (OR, 1.97; 95% CI, 1.16-3.34) had a significantly higher risk of suicidal thoughts than adolescents without these symptoms. There was no interaction between these symptom trajectories and the risk of suicidal thoughts. Conclusions and Relevance This cohort study found that persistent withdrawn symptoms and increasing somatic symptoms during early to midadolescence were associated with an increased risk of suicidal thoughts in midadolescence, even after accounting for comorbid symptoms and confounders. Attention should be paid to the suicidal risk associated with these symptoms, particularly when they persist or increase in the longitudinal follow-up.",https://doi.org/10.1001/jamanetworkopen.2023.53166,
Stay Home—The Impact of Social Distancing in Families during COVID-19 Lockdown: The Case of Cyprus,"Everyone has experiences that make them feel upset, disappointed, or fatigued. When these types of feelings are combined with certain life events or situations, such as the current COVID-19 pandemic and lockdowns, they often lead to mounting tension and stress. A crisis is a disruption or breakdown in a person’s or a family’s normal or usual pattern of functioning. The aims and objectives of this study are to explore how lockdown and social distancing had an impact on family relations in Cyprus and to what extent affected stress level of participants. By examining the impact of social distancing among adults 18 and older (N = 160), valuable conclusions were extracted. Therefore, the purpose of the study is to strengthen the idea of using alternative approaches in social preventions and/or interventions in crisis in order to deal with stress. The study argues that the disruption of usual patterns of functioning, in addition to other psychosocial and economic factors, diminishes the quality of life, resulting in tension and stress in a family environment. On the other hand, findings from the current study indicate an enhancement of relationships in challenging times, such as the COVID-19 pandemic.",https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci10100354,
Changes in Turkish- and resettler-origin adolescents’ acculturation profiles of identification: A three-year longitudinal study from Germany,"Little is known on how ethnic minority adolescents develop acculturation profiles of identification (e.g., integrated or separated). This 3-year longitudinal study first classified Turkish-origin (n = 344) and resettler-origin (n = 121) ethnic minority adolescents (M age = 14.2, SD = 1.54 , 51.6 % female) living in Germany according to their levels of ethnic and national identification. Latent profile analyses identified four profiles for the former and three profiles for the latter group. Latent transition analyses revealed considerable instability of class attributions. Integration declined among both groups while experiences of ethnic discrimination increased the likelihood to transition from the integrated to the separated profile only among Turkish-origin youth. While common, integration is also fragile.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/pq9ae,
Trajectory of Post-traumatic Stress and Depression among Children and Adolescents Following Single-incident trauma,"Objective: PTSD-depression has high comorbidity and understanding their relationship is of clinical and theoretical importance. A comprehensive way to understand posttrauma psychopathology is through symptom trajectories. The study aimed to look at the developmental courses of PTSD and depression symptoms in the initial months posttrauma, and their interrelationship in children and adolescents by utilizing advanced group-based trajectory modeling (GBTM). Methods: Two-hundred-and-seventeen children and adolescents aged between eight and 17 exposed to single-event trauma were included in the study. Their PTSD and depression symptoms were measured at two weeks, two months and nine months, with further psychological variables measures at the two-week assessment. Results: The GBTM modeling yielded a three-group model for PTSD and a three-group model for depression. All participants’ PTSD symptoms reduced to non-clinical level by nine months: participants were observed to be resilient (42.4%) or to be able to recover within two months (35.6%), while 21.9% experienced high level PTSD symptoms but recovered in nine months time. The depression trajectories described a chronic non-recovery depression group (20.1%) and two mild symptom groups (45.9%, 34.0%). Further analysis showed high synchronicity between PTSS and depression groups but predictor analysis revealed disparate predictors. Perievent panic (CPP), appraisal (CPTCI), rumination and thought suppression at week two predicted slow recovery from PTSS, while pre-trauma wellbeing (CPAS), post-trauma anxiety (SCAS) and appraisal (CPTCI) predicted chronic depression. Conclusions: Posttrauma depression was more persisting than PTSD symptoms at nine months in the sampled population. Cognitive appraisal may be central to explaining PTSD-depression comorbidity.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/52exk,
Political Participation And Protest Regulations In The Republic Of Bulgaria In 2013,"Abstract Holding a meeting or demonstration is a constitutional right (Art. 43 of the Constitution). The order is defined in the Law on gatherings, meetings and manifestations, and every municipal council shall issue an ordinance regulating the details for conducting such events in their country. However, the ongoing protests and counter-protests in Bulgaria have caused debates regarding the mass gatherings out in the open under the Bulgarian Law on gatherings, meetings and manifestations. Entered into force on 2.02.1990, the law does not seem a sufficient answer to the people's expectations for responsiveness to current conditions and dynamic public relations. The present article aims to indicate new practices in the forms of political participation in Bulgaria in 2013.",https://doi.org/10.1515/kbo-2015-0085,
"The association of chronotype, sleep duration and trajectories of health-risk behaviors among college students: a cohort study","Abstract Purpose: To describe the trajectories of health-risk behaviors (HRBs) among college students through four consecutive surveys and explore the relationship between chronotype, sleep duration and different trajectories of HRBs. Methods: We used a data sample of 1,042 college students from the College Student Behavior and Health Cohort Study. Students reported sleep parameters, including chronotype (Morning and Evening Questionnaire-5, MEQ-5) and sleep duration. The behavior scale was used to evaluate four HRBs (smoking, alcohol use, low physical activity, smartphone addiction). The latent class growth analysis (LCGA) was used to estimate the trajectory of self-reported HRBs. Multivariate logistic regression models were used to study whether sleep parameters (chronotype and sleep duration) correlated with HRBs' trajectories. Results: Four unique trajectories of behaviors were identified: unhealthy group (7.4%), increasing group (21.3%), decreasing group (10.3%) and healthy group (61.0%). Compared with the normal sleep, results from logistic regression analyses indicated that long sleep (&gt;9 h) was associated with the decreasing group and the unhealthy group( p &lt;0.05), while short sleep (&lt;7 h) was associated with the increasing group and the unhealthy group( p &lt;0.05). Compared with the M-types, the E-types were positively correlated with the unhealthy group, the increasing group, and the decreasing group ( p &lt;0.05). Conclusion: E-types and aberrant sleep duration (short and long sleep duration) were significantly associated with the trajectory of HRBs. Findings underscore the need for targeted screening and prevention of modifiable sleep behaviors with the aim of improving HRBs in college students.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-1622136/v1,
A Longitudinal Investigation of the Impact of Operational Deployment on the Psychological Wellbeing of New Zealand Defence Force Service Personnel,"&lt;p&gt;The deleterious impact of combat on psychological wellbeing has been documented as early as 490 B.C. by Greek historians (Bentley, 2005), and researchers continue to delve into this phenomenon today. Published literature in this field largely emanates from the United States and United Kingdom, whilst research from New Zealand is largely absent. The current study seeks to fill this gap with an investigation of the impact of overseas deployment on the psychological wellbeing of New Zealand Defence Force (NZDF) military personnel. This study utilised data from 1410 NZDF military personnel who operationally deployed between 1 July 2015 and 31 October 2016 and completed two questionnaires: (1) immediately following deployment, and (2) six months after returning home. Regression, moderation, mediation, and path model analyses were used to analyse the data. Several key findings were obtained. Firstly, combat stressors, as expected, predicted posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) symptoms but surprisingly not psychological distress. PTSD, as expected, predicted distress. Secondly, moderation analysis revealed that experiencing medium to high levels of non-combat stressors in addition to combat stressors was likely to result in exacerbated levels of PTSD symptoms. Thirdly, demographic characteristics such as being in the Navy, being female, and not being in a relationship were all identified risk factors for poorer psychological outcomes (PTSD symptoms and psychological distress), whereas neither ethnicity nor prior deployment experience functioned as risk factors. Lastly, mediation analysis revealed that PTSD partially explained the relationship between combat events and posttraumatic growth, suggesting that PTSD symptomology may prompt military personnel to appraise outcomes from their deployment, and subsequently experience personal growth. Implications of the current research lay in the potential for improvements to be made to the education, training, and support offered by the NZDF to their service personnel.&lt;/p&gt;",https://doi.org/10.26686/wgtn.17134598.v1,
Hidden depths,"This thesis investigated the performance of a class of statistical models, known as finite mixture models, in uncovering hidden classes of subjects following distinct temporal patterns of development. Such models have great utility when a grouping variable is either unknown (such as true disease diagnosis given clinical measurements) or is expensive to measure (a rare genetic marker given an observable trait). By studying potential data conditions and statistical model specifications which could influence the accuracy of uncovering these hidden groups, this thesis strove to increase the applicability of such models in applied research and precision medicine. This is important as the proper identification of hidden classes of temporal development could assist practitioners in the early diagnosis of disease and/or treatments tailored for the individual. To this end, practical guidelines for practitioners to properly employ these models in their research are developed.",https://doi.org/10.26481/dis.20221221gn,
"Housing First, Connection Second: The Impact of Professional Helping Relationships on the Developmental Trajectories of Housing Stability for People Facing Severe and Multiple Disadvantage","Abstract Background . This study sought to establish the impact of professional helping relationships on the developmental trajectories over 24 months of housing stability for 2,141 people facing severe and multiple disadvantage using data from the Housing First controlled trial in Canada. Method: The study used a mixed method design. Latent growth curve and growth mixture models assessed the impact of working alliance across the sample as a whole and within subgroups with different patterns of housing stability. Thematic analysis explored the factors that may affect the quality of working alliances within different subgroups. Results: Three distinct trajectories of housing stability emerged (i.e., Class 1: “sharp, sustained, gradual decline”; Class 2: “hardly any time housed”; Class 3: “high, sustained, and gradual decline”) with professional helping relationships having different effects in each. The analysis revealed structural and individual circumstances that may explain differences among the classes. Conclusions: The findings underscore the role of the relationships, as distinct from services, in major interventions for highly disadvantaged populations, and draws new attention to the temporal patterns of responses to both the quality of relationship and targeted interventions.

Sensation seeking as a predictor of psychopathology in Danish soldiers deployed to Afghanistan,"Identifying methods that enable prediction of psychopathology that results from military service is crucial for individual and mission readiness, and for postdeployment mental health. In the present study, we investigate the relationship between sensation seeking (SS) and posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and between SS and depression. Data from 743 Danish soldiers deployed to Afghanistan in 2009 were collected 6 times: before deployment, during deployment, 1–3 weeks after homecoming, 2 months after homecoming, 7 months after homecoming, and 2.5 years after homecoming. In this study, we did not find a relationship between SS and PTSD, or between SS and depression. The present study does not support previous findings that link SS with psychopathology. The structural environment in the military setting, the extent of exposure and type of stressful situations may play a moderating role. More extreme environments, such as imprisonment and torture, may favor different expressions of SS. Further research should include other factors such as context and the extent and type of traumatic exposure in relation to SS.",https://doi.org/10.1080/08995605.2018.1478544,
Divergence between Adolescent and Parental Perceptions of Conflict in Relationship to Adolescent Empathy Development,"Adolescents’ developing empathy may be associated with the frequency of conflict with parents, as well as the level of agreement between adolescent and parental perceptions of the frequency of such conflicts. This six-year longitudinal study investigated the link between adolescent empathy development and perceptions of the frequency of parent-child conflict, as reported by 467 adolescents (43% female, from age 13) and both parents. First, we investigated heterogeneity in empathy development by identifying classes of individuals with similar developmental trajectories. Adolescents were categorized into high-, average-, and low-empathy classes. Initial differences between these classes further increased from age 13 to 16, particularly for cognitive empathy. To assess the association between empathy and the frequency of conflict, we compared these empathy classes in terms of initial levels and over-time changes in the frequency of adolescent- and parent-reported conflict. Compared to the average- and high-empathy classes, the low-empathy class evidenced elevated conflict throughout adolescence. Furthermore, the low- and average-empathy classes demonstrated temporary divergence between adolescent- and parent-reported conflict from early- to mid-adolescence, with adolescents underreporting conflict compared to both parents. Adolescents’ agreement with parents was moderated by empathy class, while parents were always in agreement with one another. This may suggest that these discrepancies are related to distortions in adolescents’ perceptions, as opposed to biased parental reports. These findings highlight the potential importance of early detection and intervention in empathy deficiencies, and suggest that lower adolescent empathy may indicate elevated family conflict, even if a failure to consider parents’ perspective leads adolescents to underreport it.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/ny43t,
Group-Based Trajectory Modelling (GBTM) To Assess the Effect of Medication Adherence on Health-Related Outcomes: A Protocol for A Systematic Review,"Abstract Background: The Group-based trajectory modelling (GBTM) method is increasingly used in pharmacoepidemiologic studies to describe medication adherence trajectories over time. However, assessing the effects of these medication adherence trajectories on health-related outcomes remains challenging. The purpose of this review is to describe studies assessing the effects of medication adherence trajectories estimated by the GBTM method on health-related outcomes. Methods: We will conduct a systematic review according to the recommendations of the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Review and Meta-analysis (PRISMA) guidelines. We will search in the following databases: PubMed, Embase, PsycINFO, Web of Science, CINAHL, and Cochrane database up to April 1st, 2021. Two reviewers will independently select articles and extract data. Discrepancies at every step will be resolved through discussion, and consensus will be reached for all disagreed articles. A third reviewer will act as a referee if needed. We will use tables to synthesize the modalities used to estimate medication adherence trajectories and the effect of adherence trajectories on health-related outcomes. We will identify the types of health-related outcomes studied and how they are defined, the statistical models used, the effect measure yield, and how medication adherence trajectories have been incorporated in the model. We will also review the limitations and biases reported by the authors and their attempts to mitigate them. We will provide a narrative synthesis. Discussion: This review will provide a clear view of the strategies and methods used in medication adherence research to estimate the effects of adherence trajectories on different health-related outcomes. A thorough exploration of how GBTM is used for this specific purpose could represent the first crucial steps towards optimizing the utilization of this method in adherence studies.

Associations Between Developmental Timing of Child Abuse and Conduct Problem Trajectories,"Abstract Background Although there is strong evidence for a relationship between child maltreatment and conduct problems, associations between child abuse experienced at different developmental stages and developmental trajectories of conduct problems have not been examined. We sought to investigate effects of timing of child abuse on conduct problem trajectories in a large UK-based birth cohort study. Methods We applied latent class growth analysis to identify conduct problem trajectories in the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children, using parent-rated conduct problems from ages 4-17 years ( N =10648). Childhood-only and adolescence-only abuse, in addition to abuse in both developmental periods (‘persistent’ abuse), were assessed by retrospective self-report at age 22 years ( N =3345). Results We identified four developmental trajectories: early-onset persistent (4.8%), adolescence-onset (4.5%), childhood-limited (15.4%), and low (75.3%) conduct problems. Childhood-only abuse and ‘persistent’ abuse were associated with increased odds of being on the early-onset persistent and adolescence-onset conduct problem trajectories compared to the low conduct problems trajectory. Adolescence-only abuse was not predictive of trajectory membership. There were no associations between abuse and childhood-limited trajectory membership. Conclusions Early-onset persistent and adolescence-onset conduct problems showed similar patterns of associations with abuse exposure, challenging developmental theories that propose qualitative, as opposed to quantitative, differences in environmental risk factors between these trajectories. The results also highlight that childhood-only and ‘persistent’ abuse were more strongly linked to elevated conduct problem trajectories than adolescence-only abuse, and that ‘persistent’ abuse is particularly detrimental.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-60834/v1,
Predicting relationship change across the transition to parenthood: Resources and risk factors,"This dissertation investigates how parents’ romantic relationship changes across the transition to parenthood. Using two longitudinal datasets (N = 109 and N = 210 couples) it aims to identify pre-pregnancy and prenatal strengths and vulnerabilities that predict adaptation to, and relationship quality change across, the transition to parenthood up to ... read more several years post-partum. The first study examined positive relationship processes as resources that predict parent’s adaptation to parenthood. The second studied pre-pregnancy happiness as a resource that predicts changes in relationship commitment across the transition to parenthood. The third and fourth studies explored the existence of subgroups in changes in relationship satisfaction, and resources and risk factors as predictors of subgroup membership. The results show that parents with higher levels of resources and lower levels of risk factors fare better across the transition to parenthood in terms of relationship satisfaction, commitment, and adaptation. The predictive power of pre-pregnancy and prenatal factors suggest that childbirth does not create sudden changes in the relationship, but intensifies pre-existing strengths and weaknesses in the relationship. In addition, the results show that parents are a diverse group with unique patterns of change across the transition to parenthood. The majority of parents reported stable relationship satisfaction across the transition to parenthood, while only small subgroups experienced a (strong) decline in satisfaction. The results suggest that early detection of at-risk parents is possible, and this implies that that the efficacy of interventions might be improved by focusing on these parents and increasing their personal and relational resources. show less",https://doi.org/10.33540/816,
Assessing Phenotypic and Polygenic Models of ADHD to Identify Mechanisms of Risk for Longitudinal Trajectories of Externalizing Behaviors,"Background: Children with ADHD frequently engage in higher rates of externalizing behaviors in adulthood relative to children without. However, externalizing behaviors vary across development, and not all children with ADHD will go on to exhibit externalizing behaviors as adults. Furthermore, little is known about how this risk unfolds across development. Phenotypic and polygenic models of childhood ADHD were used to predict individual differences in adult externalizing trajectories. Supportive parenting, school connectedness, and peer closeness were then examined as causal mechanisms. Methods: Data were from the National Longitudinal Study of Adolescent to Adult Health (N=7,674). Externalizing behavior was measured using data from age 18-32 and modeled using latent class growth analysis. Child ADHD was measured using retrospective self-report (phenotypic model) and genome-wide polygenic risk scores (polygenic model). Multiple mediation models examined the direct and indirect effects of the phenotypic and polygenic models (separately) on externalizing trajectories through the effects of adolescent supportive parenting, school connectedness, and peer closeness.Results: Phenotypic and polygenic models of ADHD were associated with being in the High Decreasing (3.2% of sample) and Moderate (16.1%) adult externalizing trajectories, but not the severe Low Increasing trajectory (2.6%), relative to the Normal trajectory (78.2%). Associations between both models of ADHD on the High Decreasing and Moderate trajectories were mediated through the effects of school connectedness, but not supportive parenting or peer closeness. Conclusions: Findings shed light on how childhood ADHD affects downstream psychosocial processes that then predict specific externalizing outcomes in adulthood. They also reinforce the importance of fostering a strong school environment for adolescents with (and without) ADHD, as this context plays a critical role in shaping the development of externalizing behaviors in adulthood.",https://doi.org/10.31219/osf.io/z2hng,
"A Scoping Review of Children, Empowerment, and Smartphone Technology Regarding Social Construction Theory with the Aim of Increasing Self-Direction in Democracies","Children are Dependents in a version of social construction theory regarding their inability to self-direct their behavior in democratic society. In this regard, childhood represents a lack of self-direction, a life period when people require the guidance and protection of adults. The assumed necessity of adults supervising children in democracies necessitates substantial social resources, reducing the self-direction of those charged with overseeing children. Given that self-direction defines the optimal experience of people within a democratic society, finding ways to increase the self-direction of children is an individual and a social benefit. In this regard, smartphones have improved self-direction in children. How children have become empowered to self-direct their lives with smartphone use considering social construction theory—as Advantaged, Contenders, or Deviants—is the focus of a scoping review conducted on “children, empowerment, smartphones” of the following databases: OVID, JSTOR, ProQuest, PubMed, Scopus, and Web of Science. The result is that children permitted to self-direct their activities aided by smartphone technology have comparable social behavior to adults positioned as Advantaged, Contenders, or Deviants, and as such, they should be encouraged to utilize smartphone technology to improve their self-direction, as doing so will augment individual and caregiver self-direction, providing increased social benefit.",https://doi.org/10.3390/socsci13040196,
Trajectories of children’s intrusive grief and association with baseline family and child factors and long-term outcomes in young adulthood,"Abstract This study reports on the description of children’s distinct trajectories of intrusive grief, baseline predictors of grief trajectories, and the association of grief trajectories with mental health, substantive abuse and disordered grief six and fifteen years following baseline assessment. The study uses data on 244 parentally-bereaved children ages 8–16 at baseline. Four distinct trajectories were identified using Growth Mixture Modeling over four waves of assessment across 6 years. The trajectories were labeled high chronic grief, moderate chronic grief, grief recovery (starts high but decreases over 6 years of assessment) and grief resilience (chronic low grief). Baseline factors associated with chronic high or moderate chronic levels of grief included depression, traumatic cause of death (homicide or suicide), active inhibition of emotional expression, active coping, child age and gender. At the six-year assessment, trajectories were associated with internalizing mental health problems, higher level of traumatic grief, and aversive views of the self. At the fifteen-year assessment, trajectories were associated with intrusive grief. The results are interpreted in terms of consistency with prior evidence of children’s long-term grief, theoretical processes that may account for chronic grief and implications for the development of preventive and treatment interventions.",https://doi.org/10.1017/s0954579424001834,

Health and Wellbeing Cohort Study of Serving and Ex-Serving UK Armed Forces Personnel: Phase 4 Protocol,"Abstract Introduction This is the fourth phase of a longitudinal cohort study (2022-2023) to investigate the health and wellbeing of UK serving (Regulars and Reservists) and ex-serving personnel (veterans) who served during the era of the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts. The cohort study was established in 2003 and has collected data over three previous phases including Phase 1 (2004-2006), Phase 2 (2007-2009) and Phase 3 (2014-2016). Methods and analysis Participants are eligible to take part if they completed the King’s Centre for Military Health Research (KCMHR) Health and Wellbeing Cohort Study at Phase 3 (2014-2016) and consented to be recontacted. Participants meeting these criteria will be recruited through email, post, and text message to complete an online or paper questionnaire. The study provides a fourth phase of quantitative longitudinal data on this cohort. Data are being collected between January 2022 and September 2023. Health and wellbeing measures used in Phase 4 include measures used in previous phases that assess common mental disorders (CMD), post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and alcohol misuse. Other areas of interest assess multiple symptom illness, employment, help-seeking, and family relationships. New topics include the impact of the British withdrawal from Afghanistan in 2021, Complex-PTSD (C-PTSD), illicit drug use, gambling, and loneliness. The main analyses will compare mental health status according to deployment experiences and serving status (serving or ex-service) reporting prevalences with 95% Confidence Intervals (CI), and Odds Ratios (ORs) with 95% CI. Analyses will describe the effect size between groups deployed to Iraq and/or Afghanistan or not deployed, and those who are currently in service versus ex-service personnel respectively. Multivariable logistic and multiple linear regression analyses will be conducted to assess various health and wellbeing outcomes and associations with risk and protective factors, adjusting for potential confounders. Ethics and dissemination Ethical approval has been granted by the Ministry of Defence Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 2061/MODREC/21). Participants are provided with information and agree to a series of consent statements before taking part. Data are kept on secure servers and in locked cabinets/offices, with access to personally identifiable information limited. Findings will be disseminated to UK Armed Forces stakeholders and international research institutions through stakeholder meetings, project reports and scientific publications. Strengths and limitations of this study Strengths of this study include the original cohort recruitment from a random, representative sample of UK service personnel. Strengths also include recruitment from a cohort where underlying characteristics are known and longitudinal data are held on their health and wellbeing. The study has maintained validated and harmonised health and wellbeing measures across phases, whilst including new areas relevant to the cohort’s current experiences. This study will provide continued longitudinal data on this Armed Forces cohort. Study limitations include recruitment from a specific cohort; hence the study cannot comment on older era cohorts or those who joined the Armed Forces more recently.",https://doi.org/10.1101/2023.08.17.23294221,
Initial engagement and persistence of health risk behaviors through adolescence: longitudinal findings from urban South Africa,"Abstract Background: Little is known about longitudinal patterns of adolescent health risk behavior initial engagement and persistence in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: Birth to Twenty Plus is a longitudinal birth cohort in Soweto-Johannesburg, South Africa. We used reports from Black African participants on cigarette smoking, alcohol, cannabis, illicit drug, and sexual activity initial engagement and adolescent pregnancy collected over 7 study visits between ages 11 and 18 y. We fit Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate behavior engagement or adolescent pregnancy, examined current behavior at age 18 y by age of first engagement, and performed a clustering analysis to identify patterns of initial engagement and their sociodemographic predictors. Results: By age 13 y, cumulative incidence of smoking and alcohol engagement were each &gt;21%, while the cumulative incidence of other behaviors and adolescent pregnancy were &lt;5%. By age 18 y (15 y for cannabis), smoking, alcohol, and sexual activity engagement estimates were each &gt;65%, cannabis and illicit drug engagement were each &gt;16%; adolescent pregnancy was 31%. Rates of engagement were higher among males. Current risk behavior activity at age 18 y was generally unrelated to age of initial engagement. We identified three clusters reflecting low, moderate, and high-risk patterns of initial risk behavior engagement. One-third of males and 17% of females were assigned to the high-risk cluster. Sociodemographic factors were not associated with cluster membership. Conclusions: Among urban dwelling Black South Africans, risk behavior engagement across adolescence was common and clustered into distinct patterns of initial engagement which were unrelated to the sociodemographic factors assessed. Patterns of initial risk behavior engagement may inform the timing of primary and secondary public health interventions and support integrated prevention efforts that consider multiple behaviors simultaneously.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-17353/v3,
Realistic Reintegration After Imprisonment. A Sequence Analysis of the Labour Market Paths of Recently Incarcerated Individuals,"Abstract Instead of focusing on the transition to work as an indicator of social integration after imprisonment, this study approaches reintegration as a process. The labour market paths of Dutch men were mapped using the number and type of transitions, their duration and order in the first four post-prison years. To identify seven clusters with diverse labour market paths, a distinction was made between various active labour market statuses (in school, employed) and passive labour market statuses (regular benefits, disability benefits, no formal income, detained). Characteristic of most clusters is that individuals experienced few transitions during the follow-up and spent little time in employment or in prison. These findings raise the question whether popular definitions of successful reintegration after imprisonment are realistic and point towards alternative definitions.",https://doi.org/10.1093/bjc/azae052,
Shanghai Community-Based Schizophrenia Cohort (SCS): a protocol for establishing a longitudinal cohort and research database of patients with schizophrenia receiving community-based mental health treatment,"Drivers for remission, relapse and violence-related behaviour among patients with schizophrenia are the most complicated issue. This study aims to recruit a longitudinal cohort of patients with schizophrenia. Two suburban districts and two urban districts were randomly selected according to health service facilities, population, geographical region and socioeconomic status. Individuals (>18 years old) who received a diagnosis of schizophrenia following the International Classification of Diseases (10th edition) criteria within the past 3 years will be invited as participants. Assessments will be carried out in local community health centres. Data will be used to (1) establish a community-based schizophrenia cohort and biobank, (2) prospectively determine the course of multidimensional functional outcomes of patients with schizophrenia who are receiving community-based mental health treatment, and (3) map the trajectories of patients with schizophrenia and prospectively determine the course of multidimensional outcomes based on the differential impact of potentially modifiable moderators.

Initiation and persistence of health risk behaviors through adolescence: longitudinal findings from urban South Africa,"Abstract Background: Little is known about longitudinal patterns of adolescent health risk behavior initiation and persistence in low- and middle-income countries. Methods: Birth to Twenty Plus is a longitudinal birth cohort in Soweto-Johannesburg, South Africa. We used reports from Black African participants on smoking, alcohol, cannabis, illicit drugs, and sexual activity and on adolescent pregnancy collected over 7 study visits between ages 11 and 18 y. We fit Kaplan-Meier curves to estimate behavior initiation or adolescent pregnancy, examined current behavior at age 18 y by age of initiation, and performed a clustering analysis to identify patterns of initiation and their sociodemographic predictors. Results: By age 13 y, cumulative incidence of smoking and alcohol initiation were each &gt;21%, while the cumulative incidence of other behaviors and adolescent pregnancy were &lt;5%. By age 18 y, smoking, alcohol, and sexual activity initiation estimates were each &gt;65%, cannabis (age 15 y) and illicit drug initiation were each &gt;16%; adolescent pregnancy was 31%. At both ages, rates of initiation were higher among males. At age 18 y, current risk behavior activity was lower than lifetime activity and generally unrelated to age of initiation. We identified three clusters reflecting low, moderate, and high-risk patterns of risk behavior initiation. One-third of males and 17% of females were assigned to the high-risk cluster. Sociodemographic factors were not associated with cluster membership. Conclusions: Among urban dwelling Black South Africans, risk behavior experimentation across adolescence is common and clusters into distinct initiation patterns unrelated to the sociodemographic factors assessed. Understanding patterns of risk behavior initiation has implications for the timing of primary and secondary public health interventions and supports integrated prevention efforts that consider multiple behaviors simultaneously.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-17353/v1,

"Toward an integrated understanding of traumatic grief: Connecting prolonged grief, posttraumatic stress, and depression symptoms in traumatically and non-traumatically bereaved individuals","Chapter 1 & Prigerson, 2007;Silverman et al., 2000) that PGD is more strongly associated with elevated impairment than it is with PTSD or depression, respectively.The prevalence of PGD following natural loss, such as diseases and older age was estimated to equal about 10% (Lundorff, Holmgren, Zachariae, Farver-Vestergaard, & O'Connor, 2017).The prevalence of PTSD following unexpected deaths, including violent deaths and/or sudden deaths, was estimated at approximately 5% (Atwoli et al., 2017) and the prevalence of depression following the death of a partner was found to be 20% at 2 months and 14% at 7 months (Zisook, Paulus, Shuchter, & Judd, 1997).There was not much information yet about the cooccurrence of symptoms in bereaved individuals or possible temporal and causal relationships between the symptoms.Some authors have argued that PTSD symptoms could develop into PGD symptoms (Nakajima, Ito, Shirai, & Konishi, 2012;Raphael & Martinek, 1997).It makes intuitive sense that the presence of PTSD symptoms after loss may impair the processing of the loss itself, thereby prolonging grief symptoms.However, one other study (O'Connor, Nickerson, Aderka, & Bryant, 2015) found the opposite, namely that PGD symptoms may prelude PTSD symptoms over time.Studies in other samples are needed to further elucidate the relationships among PGD, PTSD, and depression. 20Different specific treatments for, respectively, depression, PGD, and PTSD (Boelen, 2006;Zisook & Shear, 2009) have been developed, and there is evidence that treatments designed for depression are less effective in reducing PGD than are those that specifically target PGD (Shear et al., 2014).Smid, Kleber, et al. (2015) suggested that the following processes may contribute to the development of PGD with comorbid PTSD and depression following unnatural losses: inadequately integrating the memory of the traumatic loss, negative appraisal of the traumatic loss, sensitivity to matching triggers and new stressors, and attempting to avoid distress.Based on existing evidence-based treatment interventions, they developed a treatment targeting these processes, called brief eclectic psychotherapy for traumatic grief (BEP-TG), which was found to be feasible in a sample of 16 refugees for PTSD symptoms (de Heus et al., 2017).However, this treatment was not further evaluated yet within refugee populations.Adaptation to loss and trauma does not occur in a vacuum.It is very likely that this is affected by the cultural context (Kleber, 1995).Most research on the development of psychopathology following bereavement had been carried out in samples of western participants or in western societies.This made it relevant to investigate the prevalence rate and occurrence of PGD, PTSD and depression symptoms more closely in a society with different notions and rituals around loss and bereavement and examine probable associations.

Working with migrants and refugees - Ethical principles and dilemmas in psychiatry,"Abstract More than 100 million people are forcibly displaced including refugees, internally displaced persons and asylum seekers who have fled their homes to escape violence, conflict, and persecution. The vulnerable group of refugees and forcibly displaced people have a high burden of mental disorders, including post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), depression, idioms of distress, and prolonged-grief disorder, which are highly related to the load of traumatic circumstances surrounding refugees associated with human rights abuses, lack of human needs, and separation from others and many refugees are severely traumatized and suffer a variety of symptoms, and not all seek help. Their mental health problems are of emergency nature place a huge burden upon services which are difficult to deliver. This implies that mental health professionals and patients are more likely than ever to come from different cultural backgrounds. To have access to mental health care is often a challenge for them and most of them do not seek help. Unfortunately, these vulnerable groups are not treated equally according to ethical principles of mental health professionals. This presentation will focus on these dilemmas and discuss them.

Eating Disorders across the life span: the role of biology and psychosocial factors,Abstract Eating Disorders are common. They onset in adolescence and affect individuals of all ages. Women are more affected than men. I will present evidence on the epidemiology of eating disorders across the lifespan. I will also review risk factors focusing in particular on biological risk factors that might explain onset of these disorders in critical periods of a woman’s life. I will also cover pyschosocial risk factors across life stages. I will present results from a series of cohort studies. I will then summarise the evidence from our own and other existing studies.

Back pain trajectories from midlife to retirement as a predictor of old age mobility and disability,"Abstract Background Low back pain (LBP) is a leading cause for mobility limitations and disability at older age. However, little is known about the developmental pathways of LBP and its associations with old age mobility and disability. We studied trajectories of LBP from midlife to retirement (16-years follow-up) and assessed the association after 12 years with mobility limitations and disability in activities of daily living (ADL) at old age. Methods Finnish municipal employees were studied at baseline in 1981 and followed for 28 years. A total of 6257 persons aged 44-58 years, answered a questionnaire on health, work ability, and working conditions. Follow-up data on frequency of LBP (never, occasionally, consistently) was collected similarly at four waves. The study population consisted of persons who answered questions about LBP at baseline and at least in one of the follow-up waves and had information about ADL disability (n = 2787) and mobility limitations (n = 2723) at the 28-year follow-up. Latent class growth curve analysis was used to study LBP trajectories. Odds ratios (OR) with their 95% confidence intervals (CIs) for associations of LBP trajectory with ADL disability and mobility limitations were estimated using multivariable logistic regression. Results We identified two trajectories of LBP: high (77%) and low (23%). People in the high trajectory group had 2.35 times higher odds (95% CI 1.88- 2.97) of ADL disability and 1.86 times higher odds (95% CI 1.56-2.22) of mobility limitations as compared to the low trajectory group. Effects were attenuated by adjustment for lifestyle factors and chronic conditions but remained statistically significant for both outcomes [OR 1.74 (95% CI 1.37-2.24) and 1.44 (1.18-1.77), respectively]. Conclusions High LBP experienced during midlife may have far reached consequences on well-being at old age. Prevention of LBP during mid-life could reduce mobility limitations and disability at old age and promote a healthy ageing. Key messages Our results show that low back pain experienced during midlife is associated with mobility limitations and disability in activities of daily living at old age. Our results suggest that emphasis should be put on promotion of musculoskeletal health in midlife as this may help to reduce disability and mobility limitations at old age.",https://doi.org/10.1093/eurpub/ckaa165.1109,
Stressful life events during the perimenopause: longitudinal observations from the Seattle Midlife Women’s Health Study,"Abstract Background Midlife is a time of increased responsibilities for women who have multiple roles including taking care of children, caring for elderly parents, managing households, and working outside the home. With little time for themselves, women additionally experience stressful life events. The purpose of this study was to describe the longitudinal patterns of stressful life events of women during midlife including socio-economic factors and demographic characteristics associated with them. Methods Women who were part of the Seattle Midlife Women’s Health Study (SMWHS), a longitudinal study spanning more than 23 years, who had stressful life events measured at baseline and at years 2, 7, and 10 were included in these analyses. The Life Event Scale, a 70-item scale based on a yes/no response and a Likert-based scoring system with 0 (no effect) to 4 (large effect), was used to determine the total and impact scores of midlife women. The LES was adapted to midlife women from the Norbeck Scale for younger, pregnant women. Analytic strategies consisted of a latent-class growth mixture module to examine subgroups of women with similar exposure to stressful life events using socio-economic factors (gross family income, education, race/ethnicity, employment) and demographic variables (age, marital status, being a parent, and menopausal transition stage) to differentiate trajectories over time. Results Women’s experience of total scores for undesirable stressful life events decreased over time; the impact was sustained over time (65% of the women) or sharply decreased (35% of the women). Women’s experience of total scores for desirable stressful life events were mostly medium high sustainers (61%) compared to high sustainers (27.3%). The impact of desirable stressful life events mostly decreased over time (92.5%). Menopausal transition stages were not significant predictors of stressful life events. Conclusion Midlife women experience stressful life events throughout the menopausal transition. Since the stages were not significant predictors of the ratings of SLEs, a more complex reason, more than biological and including social, may explain the ratings of the women over the course of this ten-year observational study.",https://doi.org/10.21203/rs.3.rs-2899715/v1,
Diagnostic Issues in Other Mental Disorders Co-Morbid With Intellectual Disability,"Abstract The assumption by ICD-11 of Intellectual Disability (ID) as part of the Neurodevelopmental Disorders, named Intellectual Developmental Disorders (IDD), bring more attention of the psychiatric community to this population and the problems they face. In the field of neurodevelopmental disorders, different diagnosis intersect, since they share symptoms, and some of those symptoms are difficult to define. At the same time, the difficulty of people with ID to conceptualize and / or express is subjective experience creates another obstacle to clearly identify witch symptoms are present. We will try to discuss these questions, and offer some references, in order to help mental health professionals to recognize the most common diagnosis in people with ID, and differentiate between them, namely Autism Spectrum Disorder, Attention-Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, Mood Disorders, and Impulse Control Disorders.

Measurement of Cannabis Consumption to Determine Risk and Promote Public Health,"Abstract With the escalation of cannabis legalization and commercialization, the need to differentiate low- vs. high-risk patterns of cannabis use, especially among frequent consumers, becomes essential for development of prevention and intervention strategies and public health messaging. The diversity of cannabis products and methods of intake make this task complex. In particular, the lack of valid methods for quantifying use of the intoxicating component of cannabis, i.e., THC, poses a difficult challenge. This presentation will describe a series of internet-based, personalized survey studies of adults who consume cannabis frequently. The aims of the studies are to develop methods for quantifying THC from self-reports of use, identify patterns of use, and determine associations between use and risk. In the first study of adult daily cannabis consumers (n&gt;4000), rates of CUD were 35% no disorder, 39% mild, 18% moderate, 8% severe disorder. Higher severity was significantly related to younger age, unemployment, and specific reasons for use. Latent class analyses identified four distinct subgroups and preliminary analyses showed that those more likely to report oral use were less likely to meet CUD criteria, and those more likely to report use of high potency products were more likely to meet moderate/severe criteria. Two studies (n’s &gt;2000) compared different quantitative formulas for estimating daily THC consumption from vaping or smoking cannabis products. Findings demonstrated how quantity (mgTHC) relates to socio-demographics, use patterns, and CUD severity. However, substantial variability in the estimates obtained across quantitation methods indicates the need for additional studies to determine optimal approaches. Overall, findings show that specific characteristics of use can discriminate low- from high-risk consumption among those who use frequently, which is critical for developing cannabis policy and public health messaging.

Modern Views of Machine Learning for Precision Psychiatry,"In light of the NIMH’s Research Domain Criteria (RDoC), the advent of functional neuroimaging, novel technologies and methods provide new opportunities to develop precise and personalized prognosis and diagnosis of mental disorders. Machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are playing an increasingly critical role in the new era of precision psychiatry. Combining ML/AI with neuromodulation technologies can potentially provide explainable solutions in clinical practice and effective therapeutic treatment. Advanced wearable and mobile technologies also call for the new role of ML/AI for digital phenotyping in mobile mental health. In this review, we provide a comprehensive review of the ML methodologies and applications by combining neuroimaging, neuromodulation and advanced mobile technologies in psychiatry practice. Additionally, we review the role of ML in molecular phenotyping, cross-species biomarker identification in precision psychiatry. We further discuss explainable AI (XAI) and causality testing in a closed-human-in-the-loop manner, and highlight the ML potential in multimedia information extraction and multimodal data fusion. Finally, we discuss conceptual and practical challenges in precision psychiatry and highlight ML opportunities in future research.",https://doi.org/10.36227/techrxiv.19502131.v1,
Internalizing and externalizing problems across childhood and psychotic-like experiences in adulthood: The role of developmental period,"Author Notes***8 April 2021: This paper is now open access and published in the journal of Schizophrenia Research: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0920996421001365#f0005.*** This manuscript has been submitted for publication and is likely to be edited as part of the peer-review process. Correspondence regarding this paper should be addressed to Keri Ka-Yee Wong, keri.wong@ucl.ac.uk. AbstractBackground Psychopathology in childhood and adolescence, commonly indexed by co-occurring internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors, has been found to predict psychotic-like experiences (PLEs) in adults. However, studies to date have rarely examined internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors simultaneously or identified in which developmental period do these problem behaviors predict PLEs in adults. This study tests to what extent internalizing and externalizing problem behaviors in childhood (4–9 years) or adolescence (11–16 years) predict PLEs in adulthood (18 years). Methods Parent-rated child internalizing and externalizing problems on the Strengths and Difficulties Questionnaire at ages 4, 6, 8, 9, 11, 13, and 16 years from the Avon Longitudinal Study of Parents and Children (N=4717) were modelled using two-piece latent growth curve modelling to predict clinician-rated PLEs at age 18 years, controlling for confounders (gender, ethnicity, socio-economic status, parental education and stressful life events) assessed prior to baseline at age 4 years.Results Controlling for confounders, an increase in childhood internalizing problems from 4 to 9 years and externalizing problems at baseline (at 4 years) predicted PLEs at 18 years, explaining 9.5% of the variance in adult PLEs. These associations were independent to controls for any changes in adolescent internalizing and externalizing problems from 11 to 16 years.Conclusions High baseline levels of externalizing problems and increasing internalizing problems throughout childhood can predict PLEs at 18 years. Externalizing problems around the transition to primary school and internalizing problems throughout childhood may be particularly helpful in informing risk of PLEs in adulthood.Keywords: ALSPAC; psychotic-like experiences; internalizing; externalizing; developmental; childhood.",https://doi.org/10.31234/osf.io/tmnvs,
Supporting the Five Cs of Positive Youth Development Amid the COVID-19 Pandemic: The Impact on Adolescents’ Bullying Behaviour,"Tailored interventions within the school context can promote the Five Cs of positive youth development—competence, confidence, character, caring, and connection—thus aiding in mitigating behaviours such as bullying. This study aimed to evaluate the effectiveness of tailored interventions targeting each of the Five Cs and its indirect impact on bullying and victimisation during school closures. The sample comprised 66 students in four experimental groups (general, technical, vocational, and short vocational school) and 47 students in two control groups (general and vocational). Each experimental group was analysed separately, considering the specific contextual needs of each. Results varied across groups: competence, character, and caring remained unchanged post-intervention, while connection increased in the experimental group from general school, and confidence decreased in the experimental groups from technical and vocational schools. When compared to control groups from each school, experimental groups from general and vocational schools had higher connection and experimental group from general school had lower competence than control group from the same school. Bullying outcomes showed a decrease in verbal bullying and victimisation in the experimental group from general school, an increase in cyberbullying in the experimental group from short vocational school, and a decrease in social bullying in the experimental group from general school. The study suggests that brief interventions can positively influence aspects of the Five Cs, impacting bullying and victimisation outcomes.",https://doi.org/10.3390/youth4010014,
"The Levels of Marital Stability among Married Couples in Selected Parishes in the Catholic Archdiocese of Nairobi, Kenya","The level of marital stability among members of a given community is important in determining the future generations of that community. This study investigated the levels of marital stability among couples in selected parishes in the Catholic Archdiocese of Nairobi (CAN), Kenya. The study was guided by the Emotion Focused Theory and employed concurrent convergent mixed methods research design. The study targeted a population of 19,828 Catholic faithful in the research area, who have exchanged their marital vows therein within the last 5 to 25 years. From these, sample of 784 married men and women were selected by multistage sampling thus census, proportionate quota and simple random sampling techniques. Data was collected using the marital Stability Questionnaire, whose resultant data was analyzed descriptively using frequency counts and percentages. Findings indicated that the marital stability of respondents in the research area was in three levels thus low, moderate and high. The study recommends that the office of the attorney general should formulate policy to ensure all newly married couples are sensitized on various aspects of marital stability before issuing them with marriage certificates.",https://doi.org/10.36349/easjpbs.2024.v06i02.004,
Developmental Trajectories of Elementary School Peer Victimization as Related to School Safety and Climate,"The goal of this study was to better understand how children’s perceptions of their school's context (both climate and safety) were related to peer victimization trajectories (both relational and physical) from grades 3 to 6. A total of 886 children from three Canadian provinces in grades 3 and 4 at baseline were followed across 5 waves from the spring of 2011 to the spring of 2013. Children’s perceptions of their physical and relational victimization experiences, school safety, and school climate (teacher-child relationships, peer relationships, and fairness) were collected at all 5 time points. Individual growth curve modeling was used to determine the level of victimization as well as the rate of changes from grade 3 to grade 6. Two cohort-sequential growth curve models indicated that relational and physical victimization declined by 8% and 10%, per year, respectively. Boys were higher in physical victimization and girls were higher in relational victimization at all time points, but declined at similar rates over time. Children who never felt safe and had overall negative relationships with their teachers reported more relational victimization across time. Boys who reported overall good teacher relationships also reported higher levels of physical victimization. Children who never felt safe reported the highest levels of relational and physical victimization. Poor peer relationships and feeling safe sometimes were associated with slight increases in physical victimization, whereas good peer relationships were associated with slight decreases in physical victimization. The lack of contribution of teacher relationships, peer relationships, fairness, and safety to the rate of decline for relational victimization suggests that more research is needed to determine the factors beyond those measured that will increase the rate of decline. Multiple relationships may be associated with children’s trajectories of peer victimization and highlight the necessity of assessing family, peer, as well as teacher relationships within a single study.",https://doi.org/10.22215/etd/2017-11959,
Effectiveness of Social Skills Training for children with autism spectrum disorder,"Children with an autism spectrum disorder (ASD) have limitations in social communication and interaction. In clinical practice, social skills training (SST) is applied as treatment to improve these skills. This dissertation describes a study in 122 children with ASD, aged 9-12 years, into the effectiveness of SST directly after the training and on the longer term, and into the effect of involving parents and teachers in the training.Social skills and cooperation improved more in children who had participated in the training compared to children who had only received regular care. This improvement was modest. Contrary to my expectations, based on what parents reported, I found no differences between children whose parents and teacher were involved in the SST compared to children who were trained without parent and teacher involvement. Teachers reported something different: they reported significantly more improvement in children who participated in the SST with parent and teacher involvement than in children who participated in the SST without this involvement. We found no improvement six months after the training of either form. Further examination of the group of children who improved after SST showed that this group was younger, verbally stronger, and less anxious. In addition, their parents reported that these children experienced the social communication skills that they learned during the training as less difficult before the start of the training.",https://doi.org/10.33612/diss.193918122,
"Identifying Positive Adaptive Pathways in Low-Income Families in Singapore: Protocol for Sequential, Longitudinal Mixed-Methods Design (Preprint)","<sec> <title>BACKGROUND</title> This study aims to examine the adaptive process of children and mothers from multistressed low-income families in Singapore. It aims to bridge the knowledge gap left by existing poverty studies, which are predominately risk focused. Through a sequential longitudinal mixed-methods design, we will differentiate children and mothers who demonstrate varied social, developmental, and mental health trajectories of outcomes. Through utilizing the Latent Growth Curve Model (LGCM), we aim to detect the development and changes of the positive Family Agency and adaptive capacities of these families over time. The construct of Family Agency is underpinned by the theoretical guidance from the Social Relational Theory, which examines child agency, parent agency, relational agency, and the interactions among these members. It is hypothesized that positive Family Agency within low-income families may lead to better outcomes. The key research questions include whether the extent of positive Family Agency mediates the relationship among financial stress, resource utilization, home environment, and parental stress. </sec> <sec> <title>OBJECTIVE</title> The study elucidates the Family Agency construct through interviews with mother-child dyads. It also aims to understand how financial stress and resources are differentially related to home environment, parent stress, and parent and child outcomes. </sec> <sec> <title>METHODS</title> In phase 1, 60 mother-child dyads from families receiving government financial assistance and with children aged between 7 and 12 years will be recruited. In-depth interviews will be conducted separately with mothers and children. On the basis of 120 interviews, a measurement for the construct of Family Agency will be developed and will be pilot tested. In phase 2a, a longitudinal survey will be conducted over 3 time points from 800 mother-child dyads. The 3 waves of survey results will be analyzed by LGCM to identify the trajectories of adaptation pathways of these low-income families. In addition, 10 focus groups with up to 15 participants in each will be conducted to validate the LGCM results. </sec> <sec> <title>RESULTS</title> This project is funded by the Social Science Research Thematic Grant (Singapore). The recruitment of 60 mother-child dyads has been achieved. Data collection will commence once the amendment to the protocol has been approved by the Institutional Review Board. Analysis of phase 1 data will be completed by the end of the first quarter of 2019, and the first set of results is expected to be submitted for publication by the second quarter of 2019. Phase 2 implementation will commence in the second quarter of 2019, and the project end date is in May 2021. </sec> <sec> <title>CONCLUSIONS</title> Findings from this study can potentially inform social policy and programs as it refines the understanding of low-income families by distinguishing trajectories of adaptive capacities so that policies and interventions can be targeted in enhancing the adaptive pathways of low-income families with children. </sec> <sec> <title>INTERNATIONAL REGISTERED REPOR</title> PRR1-10.2196/11629 </sec>",https://doi.org/10.2196/preprints.11629,
A Narrative Inquiry into the Influence of School Shooting Survival on College Transition and Experience,"There is an extensive body of school-related shooting research exploring causes, how to recognize a threat, and what preparedness measures are effective (Lee et al., 2020; Muchert, 2007). However, there is insufficient research on how the broader context of school-related shootings in American society has influenced college-aged students. The purpose of this study was to tell the story of how students have been influenced by their experience surviving the 2018 Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting during their transition to and performance in higher education. Narrative inquiry provided a deeper understanding through narrative retelling of the perceptions, decisions, and experiences of school shooting survivors. Schlossberg’s transition theory provided a framework by which to analyze participant experiences. This study narrowed a gap in the existing literature by exploring and uncovering school shooting survivor experiences during their transition and time in college. Participants shared important information and perspective on their challenges making friends, processing trauma, and exploring their interests outside of advocacy work. Findings demonstrate the importance of substantial mental health support in college.",https://doi.org/10.33915/etd.11616,
Screen on = development off? A systematic scoping review and a developmental psychology perspective on the effects of screen time on early childhood development,"Research on the associations between screen time and child development suggests that various forms of screen time might pose a risk for various aspects of child development. However, data on the impact of exposure to screen media on the development of children under 3 years of age is comparatively scarce. Although the evidence available on the topic is evolving rapidly, no review of existing literature has yet encompassed a comprehensive set of developmental outcomes with a focus in the first 3 years of life. To address this research gap, the present literature review focused on the influences of screen time on various developmental outcomes of children aged zero to 36 months. These outcomes were sleep-related parameters, physical health, cognition, learning efficiency, language, motor skills, socio-emotional skills, social interaction, and overall development. To this end, ten databases were searched systematically, and 158 studies that were published between the launch of the iPhone in early 2007 until 2024 were included. Only studies that reported specific results for the age range of zero to 36 months were examined, including longitudinal studies with samples of children aged zero to 36 months at the first wave of assessment. For most outcomes, a comparable amount of undesirable and non-significant associations was found with children's screen time, while few desirable associations were reported. In line with the notion of resilience, these results indicate that characteristics of the child, the context, and/or the content moderate the associations between screen time and child development in early childhood, thus contributing to mitigating the potential of displacement of learning opportunities or even creating new learning opportunities. More studies with designs that can examine the causal effect of screen time on child development and that explicitly address the role of child, content, and context variables are needed.",https://doi.org/10.3389/fdpys.2024.1439040,

Perfil das pessoas em situação de rua com problemas de saúde mental decorrentes do uso de álcool e outras drogas: revisão de escopo,"The number of homeless people with mental health issues due to the use of alcohol and other drugs has grown significantly in the world.São Paulo city can be considered a reflection of this growth.Data published by the State Social Development Secretary show a 160% raise in the flow of drug users in the central part of the city, between the years 2016 and 2017.Therefore, this study seeks to outline the profile of this population through a synthesis of the literature already published in this area.Objective: To analyze the scientific production regarding homeless people who use alcohol and other drugs, published since 2009.Method:Scoping Review, in which the results were obtained by searching articles published in the LILACS/BVS, PUBMED and Google Academic databases.The choice of references followed the next eligibility criteria: complete studies, online availability, published since 2009, in Portuguese, English and Spanish.Results: 9 articles were analyzed, 7 are national (Brazil) and 2 international, and submitted to the application of a data extraction instrument.The results of the analyzes point that the homeless population with mental health issues due to the use of alcohol and other drugs is mostly composed of men, with brown being the predominant color/race, with no elementary school degree.Most frequent causes found as reason for staying on the streets were drug use and family disagreements.Regarding drug consumption, alcohol, tobacco, and crack were found to be the most used substances. Conclusion:Through the analysis proposed by this study it was possible to observe important data regarding the characteristics of the homeless population using alcohol and other drugs.It is concluded that characterization studies are essential to improve the life quality of people in a vulnerable situation, once these studies provide resources for the creation of effective strategies in the guaranteeing the rights and fighting social and health adversities that these people face.",https://doi.org/10.11606/d.7.2020.tde-01032021-125746,
"Media and Society, 2022","The research is focused on the development of the means of artistic expression applied in the cinema of a specific time period , analysing the films made at the Riga Film Studio (Rīgas Kinostudija), commissioned by the Central Television of the USSR.Both innovative and formal solutions can be found in the films of that era, especially considering the creation of the two-part format.The current publication focuses on the genesis of the artistic and production processes of the film ""Lielais dzintars"" (""The Great Amber"", ""Dziesma par Rīgu"" / ""A Song About Riga"", 1972), in the context of the cinema development of that time, based on the documents of the Latvian State Archives of the Latvian National Archives.The inclusion of humorous elements in the film's narrative, the use of music, visually impressive Latvian landscapes on the screen, an international cast corresponding to the scale of the USSR, was a way to sell the film to the customer.Riga Film Studio and its authors agreed to modify the script and film several times, subjecting themselves to artistic compromises.Censorship in the USSR realized its ideological goals by idealizing the Soviet man's way of life, destroying the narrative and aesthetics of the film ""Lielais dzintars"".",https://doi.org/10.22364/ms22,
A Longitudinal Typology of Neighbourhood-level Social Fragmentation: A Finite Mixture Model Approach,"Neighbourhoods are social enclaves. And, from an epidemiological vantage there is substantive research examining how social traits of neighbourhoods affect health. However, this research has often focused on the effects of social deprivation. Less attention has been given to social fragmentation (SF), a construct aligned with the notions of lesser: social cohesion, social capital, collective functioning, and social isolation. Concurrently, there has been limited research that has described the spatial and temporal patterning of neighbourhood-level social traits. With a focus on SF the main aims of this paper were to model and describe the time-varying and spatial nature of SF.Conceptually, this research was informed by ‘thinking in time’ and by the ‘lifecourse-of-place’ perspective. While, from an analytical perspective, a longitudinal (3-time points over 10-years) neighbourhood database was created for the metropolitan region of Adelaide, Australia. Latent Transition Analysis was then used to model the developmental profile of SF where neighbourhoods were proxied by ‘suburbs’, and the measurement model for SF was formed of 9-conceptually related census-based indicators. A four-class, nominal-level latent status model of SF was identified: class-A=low SF; class-B=mixed-level SF/inner urban; class-C=mixed-level SF/peri-urban; and class-D=high SF. Class-A and -D neighbourhoods were the most prevalent at all time points. And, while certain neighbourhoods were inferred to have changed their SF class across time, most neighbourhoods were characterised by intransience.",https://doi.org/10.31235/osf.io/56x9c,
"Physical activity and developmental psychopathology in children and adolescents: cross-sectional, longitudinal follow-up and concurrent developmental relationships","The current cumulative dissertation aimed to investigate the cross-sectional and longitudinal relationships between mental health problems, including symptoms of ADHD, and physical activity (PA) in children and adolescents. Using data from the German Health Interview and Examination Survey for Children and Adolescents (KiGGS) had the benefit of a large population sample (17640 participants) of children and adolescents from 0 to 17 years old investigated across a 10-year period. The dissertation aimed to shed additional light on the association between mental health problems and PA by addressing the following research questions: (a) whether there exists a cross-sectional relationship between general mental health problems as well as ADHD symptoms and PA in different age groups. If so, (b) whether there exists a longitudinal association between them over a 10-year period, and (c) how developmental trajectories of general mental health problems as well as ADHD symptoms, are related to those of PA. These questions led us to three separate studies. The first study used a multi-linear regression to explore the cross-sectional relationship between PA and mental health problems, including ADHD symptoms, while controlling for sex, SES, and BMI in three distinct age groups (preschool, elementary school and adolescents) at Baseline, Wave 1, and Wave 2, separately. The findings highlighted the significance of a high frequency level of PA in promoting mental health status in both children and adolescents. The second study revealed the longitudinal relationship between PA and general mental health problems, as well as symptoms of ADHD in children and adolescents, using different analyses for boys and girls. The findings showed that PA has long-term consequences on psychopathologies, particularly in preschool children. The third study examined children’s and adolescents' concurrent development of general mental health problems, ADHD, and PA over a ten-year period. The results showed (1) distinct 20 developmental trajectories for each component (for boys and girls separately) but, (2) a significant relationship between trajectories could not be found.",https://doi.org/10.53846/goediss-10106,
