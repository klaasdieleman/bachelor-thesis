# Appendix 1
## GRoLTS-checklist

1. Is the metric or unit of time used in the statistical model reported? (i.e., wave, hours, days, weeks, months, years, etc.)
2. Is information presented about the mean and variance of time within a wave?
3. Is a description provided of how missing data in the analyses were dealt with?(i.e., List wise deletion, multiple imputation, Full information maximum likelihood (FIML) etc.)
4. Is information about the distribution of the observed variables included? (i.e., tests for normally distributed variables within classes, multivariarte normality, etc.)
5. Is the software that was used for the statistical analysis mentioned?
6. Are alternative specifications of within-class heterogeneity considered (e.g., LGCA vs. LGMM) and clearly documented?
7. Are alternative shape/functional forms of the trajectories described? (e.g., was it tested whether a quadratic trend or a non-linear form would fit the data better)
8. If covariates or predictors have been used, is it done in such a way that the analyses could be replicated
9. Is information reported about the number of random start values and final iterations included?
10. Are the model comparison (and selection) tools described from a statistical perspective?
11. Are the total number of fitted models reported?
12. Is information about a one-class solution reported?
13. Are the number of cases per class reported for the final model (absolute sample size, or proportion)?
14. Are the number of cases per class reported for the all models tested (absolute sample size, or proportion)?
15. Is entropy reported?
16. Is a plot included with the estimated mean trajectories of the final solution?
17. Is a plot included of the combination of estimated means of the final model and the observed individual trajectories split out for each latent class?
18. Are characteristics of the final class solution numerically described (i.e., means, SD/SE, n, CI, etc.)?
19. Are the syntax files available (either in the appendix, supplementary materials, or from the authors)?
